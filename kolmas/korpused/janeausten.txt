Chapter 1



Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,
for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;
there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a
distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and
respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;
there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs
changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over
the almost endless creations of the last century; and there,
if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history
with an interest which never failed.  This was the page at which
the favourite volume always opened:



"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.



"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,
born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,
November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."



Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands;
but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of
himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's
birth--"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles
Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"
and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which
he had lost his wife.



Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,
in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;
how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,
representing a borough in three successive parliaments,
exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year
of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;
forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with
the arms and motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county
of Somerset," and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--



"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of
the second Sir Walter."



Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
vanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome
in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.
Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,
nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with
the place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty
as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,
who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect
and devotion.



His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;
since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character
to any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,
had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,
or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real
respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest
being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,
and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of
indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.--Three
girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy
for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to
the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.
She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,
who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle
close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,
Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of
the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously
giving her daughters.



This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years
had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still
near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,
the other a widow.



That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely
well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,
needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;
but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.
Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with
one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.
For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,
which he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,
at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights
and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,
her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together
most happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming
Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness
of character, which must have placed her high with any people
of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;
her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--she
was only Anne.



To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued
god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;
but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.



A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,
but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,
her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different
were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),
there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,
to excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,
of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely
connected herself with an old country family of respectability and
large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:
Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.



It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than
she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any
charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome
Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,
be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth
as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;
for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and
acquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face
in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot
about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.



Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.
Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given
the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years had
she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,
and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after
Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.
Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball
of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs
shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,
for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.  She had
the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being
nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;
she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,
but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced
to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within
the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up
the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,
but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of
her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,
made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it
open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,
and pushed it away.



She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,
and especially the history of her own family, must ever present
the remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter
Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported
by her father, had disappointed her.



She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,
in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,
meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.
He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death,
Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures
had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,
making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of
their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,
Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.



He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;
and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour
was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of
and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.
The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,
again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;
and the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing
his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,
he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman
of inferior birth.



Sir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that
he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man
so publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together,"
he observed, "once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of
the House of Commons."  His disapprobation was expressed,
but apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,
and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,
as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between
them had ceased.



This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval
of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man
for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose
strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter
Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom
her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.
Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was
at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons
for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.
The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was
no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,
had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention
of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully
of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood
he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.
This could not be pardoned.



Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares
to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,
the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;
such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence
in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits
of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.



But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.
She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive
the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of
Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,
but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required
in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,
moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;
but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period
he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible
for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot
was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was
not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,
that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,
from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring
in town; he had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?
Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which
we can retrench?" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first
ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,
and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off
some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing
the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added
the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,
as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,
however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent
of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged
to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose
of deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,
as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise
any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,
or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.



There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;
but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.
He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,
but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace
his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole
and entire, as he had received it.



Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in
the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments
and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of
any indulgence of taste or pride.






Chapter 2



Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold
or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable
prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,
and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to
the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense
he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as
he meant to see finally adopted.



Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
much serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision
in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.
She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;
but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous
for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what
was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.
She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of
strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions
of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.
She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,
rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;
she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little
to the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of
only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;
and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,
an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her
very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,
as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal
of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.



They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was
very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him
and Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,
and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,
who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest
in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her
in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted
to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of
honesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,
a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,
a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.



"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell,
looking over her paper, "much may be done.  If he will adopt
these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope
we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has
a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;
and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from
lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.
What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families
have done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;
and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,
as it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.
We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who
has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to
the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,
there is still more due to the character of an honest man."



This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,
his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with
all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments
could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.
She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated
Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree
of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed
there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,
than to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father
and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair
of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,
through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.



How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken
is of little consequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all:
could not be put up with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort
of life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses,
table--contractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer
with the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner
quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."



"Quit Kellynch Hall."  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,
whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching,
and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without
a change of abode.  "Since the idea had been started in the very quarter
which ought to dictate, he had no scruple," he said, "in confessing
his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him
that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house
which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.
In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would
be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way
he might choose to model his household."



Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more
of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go
was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.



There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house
in the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.
A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have
Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure
of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object
of her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,
in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.
She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;
and Bath was to be her home.



Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough
to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important
at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath
over London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient
distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending
some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction
of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been
for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that
they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.



Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.
It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house
in his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found
the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's
feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's
dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,
first, from the circumstance of her having been three years
at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,
from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter
which she had afterwards spent there with herself.



Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think
it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,
by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,
every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must
do both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,
too little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society
would improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.



The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood
for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,
and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily
engrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,
but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,
which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.
Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,
not to be breathed beyond their own circle.



Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known
to design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word
"advertise," but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned
the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on
the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,
that he would let it at all.



How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had
another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter
and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been
lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,
after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with
the additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,
who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,
at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,
as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all
that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,
could hint of caution and reserve.



Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,
and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,
than because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more
than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;
had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,
against previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest
in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open
to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements
which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured
to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;
but always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she
pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in
this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving
a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought
to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.



From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,
and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;
and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice
of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore
an object of first-rate importance.






Chapter 3



"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd
one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,
"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will
be turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be
all wanting a home.  Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,
for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.
Many a noble fortune has been made during the war.  If a rich admiral
were to come in our way, Sir Walter--"



"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter;
"that's all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall
be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken
ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?"



Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--



"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little knowledge
of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they
have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants
as any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,
what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of
any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated
as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep
the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice
and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,
might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it
worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him
which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much
I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,
with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;
in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications
will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy
naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,
that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you
the trouble of replying."



Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,
he observed sarcastically--



"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."



"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"
said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,
nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:
"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be
a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;
and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful
in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,
if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in
and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!
The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order
as they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own
sweet flower gardens being neglected."



"As to all that," rejoined Sir Walter coolly, "supposing I were induced
to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges
to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.
The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,
or men of any other description, can have had such a range;
but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,
is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being
always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard
with respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed
to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,
I assure you, be he sailor or soldier."



After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--



"In all these cases, there are established usages which
make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.
Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me
for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.
I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous
for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him."



Here Anne spoke--



"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least
an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and
all the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough
for their comforts, we must all allow."



"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,"
was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and "Oh! certainly," was his daughter's;
but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--



"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it."



"Indeed!" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.



"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds
of objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours
which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,
as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.
A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise
of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,
and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in
any other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company
with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;
Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,
without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,
and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage
you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged
to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,
and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In the name of heaven,
who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,
(Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.
What do you take his age to be?'  'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.'
'Forty,' replied Sir Basil, 'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves
my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.
I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;
but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all
knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,
till they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked
on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age."



"Nay, Sir Walter," cried Mrs Clay, "this is being severe indeed.
Have a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.
The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;
I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,
is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?
Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in
the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,
if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural
effect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician
is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even
the clergyman--" she stopt a moment to consider what might
do for the clergyman;--"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged
to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to
all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have
long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable
in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,
who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,
following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,
without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,
to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:
I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness
when they cease to be quite young."



It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak
Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,
had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application
for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards
fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,
he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.
By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,
Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired
a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,
and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places
in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;
that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,
Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a
secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,
and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,
he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,
and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong
an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description
could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,
every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.



"And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.



Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,
and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,
added--



"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,
and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,
I believe, several years."



"Then I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face
is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."



Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,
hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,
but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;
not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted
a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;
knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished
house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised
if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;
would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;
said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.



Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all
the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him
peculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,
and without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was
never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:
he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering
as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.
A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture
in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton
with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were
talking the matter over.



"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,"
continued he; "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and
taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with
business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite
unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to
say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she
told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back
at Monkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannot
recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, my
dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at
Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?"



But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not
hear the appeal.



"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember
no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent."



"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.
A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman
so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,
I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man
breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;
caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,
submitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!"



After waiting another moment--



"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.



Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.



"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.
He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,
for two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.
You remember him, I am sure."



"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.
You misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of
some man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;
quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.
One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common."



As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them
no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,
with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably
in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea
they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for
the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked
nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:
an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in
the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.



It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with
an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,
he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,
and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained
at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.



Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough
of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,
in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.
So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little
additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just
high enough, and not too high.  "I have let my house to Admiral Croft,"
would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;
a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs
a note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,
and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.
In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever
have the precedence.



Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:
but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,
that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.



Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had
such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener
to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her
flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,
with a gentle sigh, "A few months more, and he, perhaps,
may be walking here."






Chapter 4



He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,
however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,
his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action
off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,
in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home
for half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine
young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;
and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,
and feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have
been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;
but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.
They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and
deeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen
highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:
she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in
having them accepted.



A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.
Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually
withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all
the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,
and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.
He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with
more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.



Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,
to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen
in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself
to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances
of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure
even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,
which she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,
to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,
youth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference
of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother's love,
and mother's rights, it would be prevented.



Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;
but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.
But he was confident that he should soon be rich:
full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,
and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.
He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.
Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in
the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;
but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,
and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.
She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a
dangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.
Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching
to imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.



Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than
Anne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet
have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will,
though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;
but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,
with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,
be continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe
the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable
of success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,
under which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not
imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,
she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,
and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,
under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation
was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,
on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself
ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country
in consequence.



A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.
Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every
enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits
had been their lasting effect.



More than seven years were gone since this little history
of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had
softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,
but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given
in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),
or in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever
come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with
Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,
the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,
at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,
the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society
around them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,
to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found
a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had
lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,
whose landed property and general importance were second in that country,
only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance;
and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,
while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two
so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of
her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.
But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;
and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,
never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety
which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man
of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her
to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.



They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,
on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never
alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently
from what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame
Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;
but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,
to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such
certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.
She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,
and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,
delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman
in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;
and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which,
as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than
could be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,
all his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour
had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.
He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:
and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.
He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,
and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.
She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,
but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,
she had no reason to believe him married.



How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,
were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful
confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which
seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced
into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:
the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.



With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,
she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely
to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,
and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.
She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves
sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts
and their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that
perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three
of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny
any recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority
of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;
she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important
from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really
taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which
had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to
those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,
she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,
the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received
any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been
long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,
a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's
having heard of it from him.



The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying
her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,
had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by
the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge
of it afterwards.



With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,
and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,
need not involve any particular awkwardness.






Chapter 5



On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall,
Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's,
and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural
to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.



This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,
and decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously
well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,
but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,
there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality
on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,
who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished
behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,
to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.



The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts
were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;
and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been
a single preliminary difference to modify of all that
"This indenture sheweth."



Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be
the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,
he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;
and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife
as they drove back through the park, "I thought we should soon
come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.
The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be
no harm in him."--reciprocal compliments, which would have been
esteemed about equal.



The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter
proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,
there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.



Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,
or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements
of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,
she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne
though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare
of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad
of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,
everything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,
and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering
to go with the others.



Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.
Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal
of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne
when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing
that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated,
or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to
Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,
instead of going to Bath.



"I cannot possibly do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning;
and Elizabeth's reply was, "Then I am sure Anne had better stay,
for nobody will want her in Bath."



To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to
be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,
and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,
and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.



This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,
and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath
till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time
should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.



So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled
by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,
which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter
and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter
in all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry
that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,
grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,
in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,
was a very sore aggravation.



Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt
the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.
With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,
which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was
sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy
were more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father
had at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,
and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually
making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,
and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind
and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions
than any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed
by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself
from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope
of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be
so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,
have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.



She spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly
answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.



"Mrs Clay," said she, warmly, "never forgets who she is;
and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,
I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are
particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition
and rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,
I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single
so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were
a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her
so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,
would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might
be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,
can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor
Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine
you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,
though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her's
and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,
but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice
Mrs Clay's freckles."



"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anne,
"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."



"I think very differently," answered Elizabeth, shortly;
"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never
alter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more
at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it
rather unnecessary in you to be advising me."



Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless
of doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,
might yet be made observant by it.



The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,
Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good
spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the
afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate
tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.



Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this
break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was
as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become
precious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,
and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,
and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,
she had determined to make her own absence from home begin
when she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,
and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage
of Lady Russell's journey.



Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back
had been completely in the old English style, containing only
two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;
the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,
substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,
enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree
trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire,
it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,
for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,
French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch
the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect
and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.



Here Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as
well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually
meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's
house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary
alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary
had not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and
properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;
but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for
solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot
self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of
fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior
to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity
of being "a fine girl." She was now lying on the faded sofa of the
pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had
been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and
two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--



"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.
I am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature
the whole morning!"



"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anne.  "You sent me
such a good account of yourself on Thursday!"



"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well
at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life
as I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.
Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,
and not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.
I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer."



Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.
"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.
He would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not
stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.
I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."



"You have had your little boys with you?"



"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind
a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad."



"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anne, cheerfully.
"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours
at the Great House?"



"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,
except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,
but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,
not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit
the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves
out of their way."



"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.
It is early."



"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal
too much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind
of you not to come on Thursday."



"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!
You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,
and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware
that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:
and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,
have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have
left Kellynch sooner."



"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?"



"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect
in a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making
a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.
I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,
trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants
are for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns
to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,
from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:
and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:
going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.
I was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up
a great deal of time."



"Oh! well!" and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."



"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded
you must have been obliged to give up the party."



"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all
the matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange
if I had not gone."



"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party."



"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,
and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having
a carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were
so crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;
and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into
the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely
that my illness to-day may be owing to it."



A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness
on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon
sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able
to leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,
she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;
then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough
to propose a little walk.



"Where shall we go?" said she, when they were ready.  "I suppose
you will not like to call at the Great House before they have
been to see you?"



"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anne.
"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know
so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."



"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.
They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,
we may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we
have that over, we can enjoy our walk."



Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence,
neither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly
they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,
with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present
daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion
by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables
placed in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits
against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and
the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves
seemed to be staring in astonishment.



The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,
perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old
English style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove
were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,
not much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had
more modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;
but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,
young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter
all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands
of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.
Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,
their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;
they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.
Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures
of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some
comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility
of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant
and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing
but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,
that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known
so little herself with either of her sisters.



They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss
on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,
as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was
chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised,
at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both
the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.






Chapter 6



Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,
will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.
She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,
or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage
in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs
which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity
and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed
she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing
our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;
for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject
which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found
in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:
"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath
do you think they will settle in?" and this, without much
waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of,
"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,
if we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your
Queen Squares for us!" or in the anxious supplement from Mary,
of--"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away
to be happy at Bath!"



She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,
and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing
of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.



The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,
their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females
were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,
neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be
very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate
its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become
a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.
With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,
it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,
and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.



She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive
and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;
neither was there anything among the other component parts
of the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms
with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,
and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had
an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.



Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,
at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,
Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match
might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding
might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,
rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,
he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise
trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.
He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by
his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness
sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was
very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share
than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass
for a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want
of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present
from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,
for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,
he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money,
and a right to spend it as he liked.



As to the management of their children, his theory was much better
than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.  "I could manage them
very well, if it were not for Mary's interference," was what
Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;
but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of "Charles spoils
the children so that I cannot get them into any order," she never had
the smallest temptation to say, "Very true."



One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there
was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,
and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.
Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,
or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.
"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"
was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:
"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think
there was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,
you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse
than I ever own."



Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great House,
though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours
and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash
and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day."  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing
Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.
They are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,
in general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister
in the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children
as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;
but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!
Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,
it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as
I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased
with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad
to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;" or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."



She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  "Mrs Musgrove thinks
all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason
to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,
that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being
in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.
I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery
without seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,
steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;
for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them."
And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering
in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do;
but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things
to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid:
I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from
my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,
that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.
Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,
that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,
you need not be afraid of mentioning it."



Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt
not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined
at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason
why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.
And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them
after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,
"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are
about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent
you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that
it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,
especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take
place of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,
but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.
It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,
but I know it is taken notice of by many persons."



How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more
than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each
to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary
between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest
which were meant for her sister's benefit.



In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.
Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,
by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened
by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse
with the other family, since there was neither superior affection,
confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,
was rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,
for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;
but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight
of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,
or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.



She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,
but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,
to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was
little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,
as she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was
giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.
Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age
of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness
of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.
In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;
and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'
performance, and total indifference to any other person's,
gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification
for her own.



The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.
The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited
by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,
more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.
They were more completely popular.



The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,
in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins
within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,
who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come
at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,
very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,
played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which
always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--"Well
done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!
how those little fingers of yours fly about!"



So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart
must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;
all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,
beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not
think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this
sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion
to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this
the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not
think of it before.  How low it makes me!"



The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were
to be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.
"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off
as long as she could;" but was not easy till she had talked Charles
into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,
comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.
She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within
when the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house
was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced
that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,
and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice
of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,
and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,
or in the turn of sentiment and expression.



Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,
uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.
She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;
though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence
of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to
have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.
Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had
no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any
approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.
Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration
towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:
especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,
in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest
symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias
of any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently
full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by
Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--



"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had
the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country."



Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
she certainly had not.



"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?" added Mrs Croft.



She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,
when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth
of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do
for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,
that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,
and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness
applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's
present state with proper interest.



The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,
she heard the Admiral say to Mary--



"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say
you know him by name."



He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,
clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away
in his coat pockets, &amp;c., to have another moment for finishing
or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,
as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.
She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,
as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject
at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.



The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day
at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits
to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,
when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming
to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,
was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,
when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,
to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.



"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.
I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are
out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much
of poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,
for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you
why she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,
(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,
that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,
or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;
and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,
that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of
poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where,
but a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over
his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure
that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,
and of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not
be dwelling upon such gloomy things."



The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,
hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached
his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid
and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for
at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;
seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence
of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.



He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,
by calling him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a thick-headed,
unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything
to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,
living or dead.



He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals
to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen
as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board
Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia
he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters
which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole
of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;
all the rest had been mere applications for money.



In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,
so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,
so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,
that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove
should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection
of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those
extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.



She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;
and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,
her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,
had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into
greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death.
Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when
they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,
of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,
of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.



To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name
so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,
that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth
whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back
from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether
it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.
She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.
Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself
to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that
he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude
for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect
for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been
six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,
though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow,
only two perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on
introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as
they could hear of his arrival.



The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.






Chapter 7



A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,
and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,
and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,
by the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment
to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,
so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth
under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest
and best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,
in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.



Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.
She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,
where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,
when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment
brought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation
put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape
with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety
which they afterwards felt on his account.



His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury
received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.
It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;
the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,
the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,
the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend
and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,
proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession
rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.



Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care
of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.
Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were
the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;
but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson
felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words
both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,
and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;
and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts
were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give
the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind
their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted
they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable
they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,
who had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been
to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said
it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised
in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come
and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;
and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt
all the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,
he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,
that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;
and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently
more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.



The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came
with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;
and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,
could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now
no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think
that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,
to give him the meeting.  "Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,"
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,
could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.



Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;
"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced
to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;
he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour."
But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,
Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything
should happen?"



The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.
It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been
done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,
and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity
for longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused
as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?
This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,
who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father
very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being
no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his
making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,
of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.



"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said he;
"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me
quite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.
You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."



Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.
Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was
quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.
She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,
but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--



"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this
poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!
I knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is
anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,
and Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say
it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.
Talks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is
going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?
I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to
go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,
I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit
than anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother
is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all
equal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."



"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of
the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,
and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.
Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.
A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own feelings
generally make it so."



"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know
that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,
for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;
and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,
he was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves
for the sort of thing."



"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending
the whole evening away from the poor boy?"



"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;
and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think
Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.
I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.
I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."



"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,
suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles
to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain
with him."



"Are you serious?" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  "Dear me!
that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,
I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?
and it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother's feelings,
are a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles
do anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better
than leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;
I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me
excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know
you do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,
indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.
You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything
is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.
I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease
about my dear child."



The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,
and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for
the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,
in a tone of great exultation--



"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home
than you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,
I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.
Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.
It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be
a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."



"This is very kind of Anne," was her husband's answer, "and I should be
very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."



Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity
of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction
was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being
left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,
when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her
to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;
and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them
set off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,
to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;
as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,
as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be
of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her
if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself
agreeable to others?



She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.
Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.
He must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished
ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;
he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place
she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him
the independence which alone had been wanting.



Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,
talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners
in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all
to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning
to shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,
though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed
to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being
in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,
somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him
to breakfast at his father's.



Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired
after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,
seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,
by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.



The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those
of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great
that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when
Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was
come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;
his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth
proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;
and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state
as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied
without his running on to give notice.



Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,
while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was
the most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.
In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared;
they were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's,
a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,
said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,
enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons
and voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself
at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,
the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk
to the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,
and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.



"It is over! it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again,
in nervous gratitude.  "The worst is over!"



Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.
They had met.  They had been once more in the same room.



Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.
Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.
How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval
had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not
eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,
removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--
how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part
of her own life.



Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing.



Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like
wishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself
for the folly which asked the question.



On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom
might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;
for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit
at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary:--



"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was
so attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,
when they went away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not
have known you again.'"



Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.



"Altered beyond his knowledge."  Anne fully submitted, in silent,
deep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,
for he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already
acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,
let him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed
her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,
open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.
She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.



"So altered that he should not have known her again!"  These were words
which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice
that she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;
they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must
make her happier.



Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,
but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.
He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,
had spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.
She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,
she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,
confident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.
It had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been
weakness and timidity.



He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since
whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation
of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him
was gone for ever.



It was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,
fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;
actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed
which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart
for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,
in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,
excepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,
when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--



"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.
Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.
A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,
and I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,
who has had no society among women to make him nice?"



He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye
spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was
not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described
the woman he should wish to meet with.  "A strong mind,
with sweetness of manner," made the first and the last of the description.



"That is the woman I want," said he.  "Something a little inferior
I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,
I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject
more than most men."






Chapter 8



From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly
in the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together
at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer
supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was
but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.



Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;
former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;
they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,
his disposition lead him, to talk; and "That was in the year six;"
"That happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred
in the course of the first evening they spent together:
and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason
to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,
Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,
that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.
There must be the same immediate association of thought,
though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.



They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what
the commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!
Now nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party
now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it
most difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,
perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached
and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among
the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,
no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.
Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could
never become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.



When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;
and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,
who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner
of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &amp;c., and their surprise
at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement
which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,
which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,
and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board
without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,
or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.



From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper
of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--



"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,
I dare say he would have been just such another by this time."



Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove
relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.



When she could let her attention take its natural course again,
she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List
(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),
and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view
of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.



"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp."



"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.
I was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.
Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off
to the West Indies."



The girls looked all amazement.



"The Admiralty," he continued, "entertain themselves now and then,
with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.
But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands
that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible
for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed."



"Phoo! phoo!" cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!
Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,
you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there
must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her
at the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,
with no more interest than his."



"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,
seriously.  "I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.
It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;
a very great object, I wanted to be doing something."



"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore
for half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants
to be afloat again."



"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how vexed you must have been
when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."



"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" said he, smiling.
"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen
lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,
and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.
Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.
I knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,
or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days
of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after
taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck
in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate
I wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.
We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,
which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for
poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation
not having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,
and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost
in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me." Anne's shudderings
were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open
as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.



"And so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,
as if thinking aloud, "so then he went away to the Laconia, and there
he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear," (beckoning him to her),
"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.
I always forgot."



"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,
with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth."



"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid
of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure
to hear him talked of by such a good friend."



Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,
only nodded in reply, and walked away.



The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth
could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume
into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud
the little statement of her name and rate, and present
non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been
one of the best friends man ever had.



"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I
made money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise
together off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!
You know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.
Excellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,
so much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,
when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean."



"And I am sure, Sir," said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,
when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget
what you did."



Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,
hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all
near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.



"My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking
of poor Richard."



"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "he was grown so steady,
and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!
Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.
I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you."



There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this speech,
a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,
which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind wishes,
as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;
but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected
by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment
he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards
coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,
took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,
in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy
and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all
that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.



They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had
most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.
It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of
a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature
to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;
and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,
may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth
should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which
he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,
whom alive nobody had cared for.



Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.
A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,
as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,
there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in
vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.



The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,
now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation
of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,
began with--



"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,
you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson
and her daughters."



"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then."



The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies
on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,
which a few hours might comprehend.



"But, if I know myself," said he, "this is from no want of gallantry
towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,
with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make
the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.
There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women
to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear
of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command
shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."



This brought his sister upon him.



"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idle refinement!--Women
may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.
I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know
nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare
I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,"
(with a kind bow to Anne), "beyond what I always had in most of
the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether."



"Nothing to the purpose," replied her brother.  "You were living
with your husband, and were the only woman on board."



"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,
and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this
superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"



"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any
brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything
of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine
that I did not feel it an evil in itself."



"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."



"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number
of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board."



"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would
become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to
one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?"



"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville
and all her family to Plymouth."



"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,
and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.
We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days."



"Ah! my dear," said the Admiral, "when he had got a wife,
he will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have
the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,
and a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful
to anybody that will bring him his wife."



"Ay, that we shall."



"Now I have done," cried Captain Wentworth.  "When once married
people begin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently,
when you are married.'  I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then
they say again, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it."



He got up and moved away.



"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove
to Mrs Croft.



"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;
though many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic
four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,
and only once; besides being in different places about home:
Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,
and never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,
you know, the West Indies."



Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself
of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.



"And I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can exceed
the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.
When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;
and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent
on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing
to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with
excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered
always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew
what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered
in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,
or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,
when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.
I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,
or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,
nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience."



"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,
Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  "There is nothing so bad
as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,
for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when
they are over, and he is safe back again."



The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,
Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes
fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad
to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.



It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits
than Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate
him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention
of all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females
of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted
to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,
they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but
the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves
could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.
If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,
who could wonder?



These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers
were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,
equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt
that he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,
perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once
charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;
she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was
sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?
The answer was, "Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.
She had rather play.  She is never tired of playing."  Once, too,
he spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,
and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished
to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned
to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,
said, with studied politeness--



"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though she immediately
drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced
to sit down again.



Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.
His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.






Chapter 9



Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay
as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of
the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.  He had intended,
on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,
and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions
of Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much
of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching
in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,
that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all
the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.



It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves
could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly
in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral
and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves
in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,
lately added to their establishment.



Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth
among the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,
warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more
than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,
to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth
very much in the way.



Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,
pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been
a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's
introduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,
where residence was not required, lived at his father's house,
only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home
had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,
and of seeing Captain Wentworth.



Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,
but their marriages had made a material difference in
their degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,
but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while
the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,
the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired,
and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,
have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion
with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen
to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior
in cultivation and manners to all the rest.



The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride
on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness
of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased
to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.
"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"--and
Henrietta did seem to like him.



Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;
but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.



Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was
as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.
Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;
and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character
were most likely to attract him.



Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from
an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,
and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything
to take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude
or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different
at the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed
to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above
four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter
had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions
of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.
Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing
that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.



Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what
he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that
he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.
Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance
of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth
was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.
Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."



"Upon my word it would," replied Mary.  "Dear me!  If he should
rise to any very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!
'Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,
indeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta
would not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!
It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much
of your new creations."



It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred
on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished
to see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,
and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection
between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.



"You know," said she, "I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;
and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,
she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections
to those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?
Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove
of Uppercross."



Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having
a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,
and he saw things as an eldest son himself.



"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his answer.
"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has
a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from
the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,
that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very
pretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than
two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,
which is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,
that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,
and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;
but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop
comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,
and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,
he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;
Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,
and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."



"Charles may say what he pleases," cried Mary to Anne, as soon as
he was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrietta
marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse
for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth
may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt
that he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.
I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to
Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense
to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.
But Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,
for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you
would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined
to give it against me."



A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,
under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return
of indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding
Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire
was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.



As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence
that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering
the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,
than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.
Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,
good-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy
which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning
young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings
it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature
of her feelings, the alteration could not be understood too soon.



Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him
in his cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him
to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish
every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away
from Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,
when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as
the probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,
and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height
of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,
and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object
nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than
forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,
but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed
on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good
as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.
The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going
six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;
of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's
being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through
without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,
but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!
the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all
to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:
she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta
had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten
all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.



"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;
I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,
you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.
Is he coming, Louisa?"



One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,
at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into
the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little
invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.



The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,
deprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,
and could only say, "I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:
Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here," before he walked
to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.



"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,
I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural;
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,
she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released
Captain Wentworth as well as herself.



He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,
"I hope the little boy is better," was silent.



She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there
to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,
when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person
crossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,
to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one
much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,
probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth
than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.



She only attempted to say, "How do you do?  Will you not sit down?
The others will be here presently."



Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently
not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end
to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up
the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.



Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,
a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door
opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance
among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,
and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.



There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;
and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,
he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,
busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.
She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.
Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had
the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.



"Walter," said she, "get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.
I am very angry with you."



"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?
Do not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to
cousin Charles."



But not a bit did Walter stir.



In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of
being released from him; some one was taking him from her,
though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands
were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,
before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.



Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.
She could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,
with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward
to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,
the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon
forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,
that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought
to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,
produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,
as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary
and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,
and leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been
an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--they
were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.
It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards
Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,
in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference,
"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;"
and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do
what he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter's feelings,
nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better
arranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed
of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,
and it required a long application of solitude and reflection
to recover her.






Chapter 10



Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.
Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;
for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,
she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory
and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.
They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.
It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,
end in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,
and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.
Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,
and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.
She did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction
to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware
of the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph
in his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of
any claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting
the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.



After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.
Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;
a most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;
and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books
before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,
and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.
It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence
of seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter
was wise.



One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage
were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window
by the sisters from the Mansion-house.



It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came
through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,
that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded
Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,
with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes,
I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;"
Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely
what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity
which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being
to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,
however undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,
but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept
the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,
as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening
the interference in any plan of their own.



"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,"
said Mary, as she went up stairs.  "Everybody is always supposing
that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,
if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner
on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"



Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out
a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.
Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready
for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne
have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,
from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was
too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together
in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently
considered the walk as under their guidance.



Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where
the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,
to keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk
must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of
the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,
and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical
descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and
inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,
that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,
some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.
She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings
and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach
of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,
she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,
might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.
Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.
This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech
of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,
which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added:--



"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take
a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from
some of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.
I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen
very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;
she would as lieve be tossed out as not."



"Ah! You make the most of it, I know," cried Louisa, "but if it were
really so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,
as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever
separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely
by anybody else."



It was spoken with enthusiasm.



"Had you?" cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!"
And there was silence between them for a little while.



Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes
of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining
happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,
blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order
into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?"
But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.



Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes
to be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,
where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer
counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning
to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,
which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view
of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.



Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;
an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm-yard.



Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!
Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."



Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles
walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready
to do as Mary wished; but "No!" said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!"
cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be
arguing the matter warmly.



Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution
of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,
though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.
But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;
and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter
of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,
"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm
than any sitting down could do her good;" and, in short,
her look and manner declared, that go she would not.



After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,
it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he
and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt
and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top
of the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;
and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking
to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,
and saying to Captain Wentworth--



"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,
I have never been in the house above twice in my life."



She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,
followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne
perfectly knew the meaning of.



The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:
Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself
on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others
all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,
to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,
and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,
Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,
was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could
prevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through
the same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat
for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which
she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.
Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa
had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on
till she overtook her.



Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard
Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if
making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the
centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was
the first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some
eager speech.  What Anne first heard was--



"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from
doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,
by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?
No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have
made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely
to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near
giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"



"She would have turned back then, but for you?"



"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it."



"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints
you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,
the last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect
to have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than
a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;
and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,
when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and
strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist
idle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is
an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,
I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much
of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,
you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding
and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.
You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody
may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,"
said he, catching one down from an upper bough, "to exemplify:
a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,
has outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not
a weak spot anywhere.  This nut," he continued, with playful solemnity,
"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,
is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be
supposed capable of."  Then returning to his former earnest tone--"My
first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.
If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,
she will cherish all her present powers of mind."



He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa
could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,
spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.
For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.
While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,
and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,
however, Louisa spoke again.



"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects," said she;
"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense
and pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much
of the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.
I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?"



After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--



"Do you mean that she refused him?"



"Oh! yes; certainly."



"When did that happen?"



"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;
but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had
accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;
and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend
Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.  They think Charles
might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,
and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him."



The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.
Her own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,
before she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was
not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard
a great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character
was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree
of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her
extreme agitation.



As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,
and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,
felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards
collected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted
the solitude and silence which only numbers could give.



Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,
Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne
could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem
admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing
on the gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they
were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.
Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles
Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other
almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.



Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;
nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,
or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much
as the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was
ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;
and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,
and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles
and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm;
but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper
with his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,
and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was
his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads
of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began
to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,
in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,
he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had
a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.



This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it
was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,
the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been
some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.
He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,
they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;
it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.
The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked
before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride
could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.



The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an
opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,
when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.



"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.
"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room
for three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might
sit four.  You must, indeed, you must."



Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,
she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency
came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;
they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space
to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,
turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.



Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had
placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,
that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution
to give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of
his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.
This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.
She understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not
be unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it
with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,
and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,
without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder
of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged
friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,
which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded
of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.



Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions
were at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way
along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.
She then found them talking of "Frederick."



"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"
said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.  He has been
running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.
Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have
settled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make
long courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,
between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together
in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?"



"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;
"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,
she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.
I had known you by character, however, long before."



"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we
to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home
one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always
be company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;
I hardly know one from the other."



"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft,
in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that
her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy
of her brother; "and a very respectable family.  One could not be
connected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!
we shall certainly take that post."



But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out
her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;
and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,
which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance
of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.






Chapter 11



The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was even fixed;
and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,
was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning
to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.



It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,
within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,
and there must be intercourse between the two families.
This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time
at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather
as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,
she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,
almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,
in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.



She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing
Captain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed
former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;
but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and
Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,
and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell
to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,
and she too little.



These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating
her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed
quite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always
give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there,
but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.



The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way
which she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen
and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.



A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,
had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled
with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,
quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville
had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received
two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him
had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there
for four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,
his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,
and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to
by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,
and a project for going thither was the consequence.



The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked
of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;
though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,
Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed
the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,
being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,
bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off
till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,
Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.



The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;
but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;
and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in
the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,
after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,
for going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,
and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt
to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House
at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,
it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach
containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which
he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,
and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,
that it was very evident they would not have more than time
for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.



After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,
the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms
were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family
but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire
in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,
the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,
skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,
is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,
its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful
line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what
the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,
who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,
to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,
Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,
and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,
where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot
for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;
the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,
Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where
the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,
declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,
where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed
Isle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,
to make the worth of Lyme understood.



The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted
and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves
on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze
on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,
proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself
and on Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house,
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.
Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,
and he was to join them on the Cobb.



They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa
seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,
when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,
all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,
and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.



Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;
and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,
on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as
an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,
which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,
had been followed by a little history of his private life,
which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.
He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now
mourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune
and promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;
promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.
She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth
believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman
than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply
afflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition
as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings
with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,
and sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,
the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,
augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,
and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville
had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,
and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,
and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement
of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's
state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick
was very great.



"And yet," said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward
to meet the party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart
than I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.
He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;
younger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another."



They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,
dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;
and from strong features and want of health, looking much older
than Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,
the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,
a little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,
just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.



Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,
was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.
Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,
to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant
than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,
because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable
than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.
The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,
accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth
should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it
as a thing of course that they should dine with them.



There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,
and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,
so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners
of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be
benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.
"These would have been all my friends," was her thought;
and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.



On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had
a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost
in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all
the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,
to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies
of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors
against the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in
the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries
provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,
excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable
from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,
were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,
the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,
the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,
made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.



Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived
excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,
for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of
Captain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with
constant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,
he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles
and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,
sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.



Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they
quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,
burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character
of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,
their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having
more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;
that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be
respected and loved.



They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme
answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being
"so entirely out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme,"
and the "no expectation of company," had brought many apologies
from the heads of the inn.



Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened
to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined
could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,
and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it
(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.



The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,
but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;
and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than
had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick
had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of
so many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,
though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth
of the party in general.



While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,
and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed
rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse
of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.
He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of
her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;
and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.
He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,
though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having
given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects,
which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope
of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and
benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out
of their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;
it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their
usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of
the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion
as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion
or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour
and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,
he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs
of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony
of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines
which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,
and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,
that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,
and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be
seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly
were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.



His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion
to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself
the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend
a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested
to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,
such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters
of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment
as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,
and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.



Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for
the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,
and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books
on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,
and promised to procure and read them.



When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea
of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,
on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists
and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examination.






Chapter 12



Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party
the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.
They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,
which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur
which so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;
gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling
breeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--



"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,
the sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been
of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,
last spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme
for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;
and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.
Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live
entirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,
and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,
that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?
She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would
make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad
to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,
in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy
to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been
doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place
like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out
from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.
I really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,
there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.
My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.
He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous
I must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?
Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,
when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,
which may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,
only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,
if people thought there was anything to complain of."



Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,
and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into
the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good
of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?
She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;
felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very
desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,
as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at
the advantage of such resident curate's being married.



"I wish," said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,
"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate
with Dr Shirley.  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of
the greatest influence with everybody!  I always look upon her as able
to persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have
told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;
but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour
at Uppercross."



Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful,
and amused also that the course of events and the new interests
of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour
with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,
for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman
were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,
on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.
They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;
but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something
to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.
They were all at her disposal.



When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,
at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,
and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;
and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her
with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.
She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,
having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind
which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye
which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,
(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.
Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which
shewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,
a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, "That man is struck with you,
and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again."



After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about
a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards
quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against
the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.
She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,
and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about
near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.
Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.
It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;
and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again
by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely,
and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was
a man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,
and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that
she should like to know who he was.



They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,
(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party
to the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,
but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;
somebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.



The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might
compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,
and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner
of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows
and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.



"Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,
"it is the very man we passed."



The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him
as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.



"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away?"



"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night
from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were
at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath
and London."



"Elliot!"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,
before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter.



"Bless me!" cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,
it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,
just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!
In the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?
my father's next heir?  Pray sir," turning to the waiter,
"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged
to the Kellynch family?"



"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said
his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day."



"There! you see!" cried Mary in an ecstasy, "just as I said!
Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,
if it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants
take care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive
how extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had
been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.
What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,
I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something
of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!
Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,
so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,
and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,
one should have known him by the livery."



"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,"
said Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement
of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."



When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried
to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,
been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction
at all desirable.



At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself
to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch
was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.
She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him
the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having
passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt
quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage,
and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been
near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain
a perfect secret.



"Of course," said Mary, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,
the next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly
ought to hear of it; do mention all about him."



Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance
which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,
but as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given
her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it
she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil
of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth
fell on Anne.



Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain
and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed
to take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off
for Uppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together,
and out of doors as long as they could.



Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all
fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening
did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together
some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,
and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,
to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something
occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of
Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.



"Miss Elliot," said he, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have
such company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;
but what can we do?  We cannot part."



"No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe to be impossible;
but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,
and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend
may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."



"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."



"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."



"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,
just made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;
he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.
There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.
I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,
but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  "The Laconia
had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her
being sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;
wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,
travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off
to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.
That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.
You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!"



Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed
able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,
and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.



Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction
of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would
accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.
By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew
near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,
all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,
that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,
would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,
and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which
may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville
at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,
who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make
the proper adieus to the Cobb.



Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's
"dark blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by
their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as
attention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.



There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant
for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,
and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,
excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;
the sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement
for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;
he did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,
to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.
He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,
he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, "I am determined
I will:" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,
she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!
There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,
she breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment
to all who stood around!



Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.
"She is dead! she is dead!" screamed Mary, catching hold of her
husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;
and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost
her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain
Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.



"Is there no one to help me?" were the first words which
burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if
all his own strength were gone.



"Go to him, go to him," cried Anne, "for heaven's sake go to him.
I can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,
rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."



Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,
disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;
and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,
and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;
while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,
exclaimed in the bitterest agony--



"Oh God! her father and mother!"



"A surgeon!" said Anne.



He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying
only--"True, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away,
when Anne eagerly suggested--



"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?
He knows where a surgeon is to be found."



Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,
and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had
resigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care,
and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.



As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said
which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:
Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate
brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes
from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,
or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him
for help which he could not give.



Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,
which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,
to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,
to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her
for directions.



"Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "What is to be done next?
What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?"



Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.



"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:
carry her gently to the inn."



"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
collected, and eager to be doing something.  "I will carry her myself.
Musgrove, take care of the others."



By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,
to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of
a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine
as the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people
Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,
she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,
and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back
with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,
and so light of heart, they had passed along.



They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.
Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance
which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,
informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.
Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves
that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife
decided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;
all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.
They would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all
beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction,
was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,
assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband
to all who needed them.



Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,
without apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,
however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly
incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,
by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.
Mary, too, was growing calmer.



The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.
They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.
The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries
recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.



That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say
a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;
and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,
after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,
may be conceived.



The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was uttered
by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;
nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it
with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by
the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection
to calm them.



Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.



It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,
as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other
and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing
to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,
did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles
silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.
They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others
began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,
and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.
They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;
and yet perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room,
or swinging a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not
finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;
though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be
the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.
Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,
who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,
was just such another.  Between these two, she could want
no possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said
with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.



Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,
and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.
"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross;
the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;
the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they
ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time."
At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose
than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,
exerting himself, said--



"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.
Every minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off
for Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go."



Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.
He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;
but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.
So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.
She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness
of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's room,
or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!
She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,
yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought
of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,
she was anxious to be at home.



The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly
down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed,
for the parlour door was open.



"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth,
"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.
But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,
I think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,
wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,
so capable as Anne."



She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself
so spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,
and she then appeared.



"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;" cried he,
turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,
which seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,
and he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself
most willing, ready, happy to remain.  "It was what she had been
thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor
in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville
would but think so."



One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable
that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses
to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;
and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,
that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,
and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home
the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage
of sending an account of Louisa's night.



Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,
and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was
made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.
She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice
in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was
nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right
to stay in Henrietta's stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?
And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!
No, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband
could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose
when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne
was inevitable.



Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous
and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off
for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick
attending to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along,
to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed
earlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes
for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had
first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given
to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.



Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,
united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt
an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even
in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing
their acquaintance.



Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,
stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;
but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister
for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,
the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,
made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her
that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.



She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating
the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have
attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,
for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust
as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.



In the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,
and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these
circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.
How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;
what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.
It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;
always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view
of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,
his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,
when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated
walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,
he burst forth, as if wholly overcome--



"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," he cried.  "Oh God! that I had
not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!
But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!"



Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness
of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage
of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,
like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions
and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel
that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness
as a very resolute character.



They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills
and the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by
some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long
as on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,
before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been
total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back
in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her
having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,
Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.
In a low, cautious voice, he said:--



"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not
appear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether
you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in
and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?"



She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance
of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,
and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became
a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.



When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,
and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,
and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced
his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;
and when the horses were baited, he was off.





(End of volume one.)






Chapter 13



The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,
was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction
of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,
and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,
in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have
been difficulties.



They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was
much the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.
Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and
more particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure
must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well
as the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,
he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,
especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.  "She really left
nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early
to their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.
When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,
which, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been
prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,
that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."



Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father
had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.
It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,
and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed
and was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,
and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid
of the family, one who having brought up all the children,
and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,
sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery
to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could
get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being
allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of
getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;
but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,
and found practicable so soon.



They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all
the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain
every twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,
and his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense
and consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed
in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.



Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.
"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters
for one another."  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought
she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination
to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.
She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;
go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,
as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.
They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;
they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;
and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted
with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her
last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,
and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left
to the solitary range of the house was the consequence.



She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,
she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled
and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross
its cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!



If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than
former happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,
to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.
A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by
her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy
and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,
all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!



An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these,
on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out
the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough
to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome;
and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,
or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and
comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses
the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.
Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.
It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,
but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,
some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could
never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.
She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that
such things had been.



Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house
in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of
its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade
and escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes
of its mistress.



There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.
She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,
either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell
fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,
had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration
of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
a second spring of youth and beauty.



When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.
The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,
and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother
among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.
She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;
and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,
and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,
which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still
be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known
how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,
and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her
was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,
than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy
with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself
to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,
on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.



There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse
on another subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.
Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,
when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must
be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,
lament the result, and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.
Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.
She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to
Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her
briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.
When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.



Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,
but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,
that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat
of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,
be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.



The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,
which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought
a rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,
Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter
self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,
"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.
Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?
It will be some trial to us both."



Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,
in observing--



"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;
your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.
By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."



She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact
so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father
so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure
of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,
that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,
she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone
who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed
into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must unquestionably
have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded
that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,
and returning through the well-known apartments.



In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,
"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen
in their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family
to be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!"
No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where
she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description
to heave.



Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure
of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,
receiving her in that house, there was particular attention.



The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,
and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared
that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;
that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time
since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had
not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours
and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention
of quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,
particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being
the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.
This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else
could have done.



As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style
by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work
on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been
the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;
that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,
how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable
she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!
The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--



"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,
for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,
is not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,
truly!"



Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,
but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible.



"Now, this must be very bad for you," said he, suddenly rousing from
a little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.  I had not
recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.
But now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms
in the house if you like it."



"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now."



"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery
at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up
by that door.  A good place is not it?  But," (checking himself),
"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept
in the butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.
One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.
And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you
to go about the house or not."



Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.



"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral,
after thinking a moment.  "Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,
at Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.
The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience
of its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter
what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement
the house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,
that the few alterations we have made have been all very much
for the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.
I have done very little besides sending away some of the large
looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.
A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:
but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking with serious reflection),
"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.
Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away
from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon
shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my
little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing
that I never go near."



Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,
and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,
took up the subject again, to say--



"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,
pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are
settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find
with the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,
I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,
which may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,
now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,
there is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,
with my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it."



Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:
but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed
far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced
themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions
in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again
before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.



So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,
or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,
and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted
on the subject.






Chapter 14



Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after
Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been
at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;
and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross
they drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;
but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves
susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though
she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,
it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear
the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return
in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,
had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.



They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had
got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible
supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience
to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them
to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been
only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested
and hospitable.



Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident
by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.
Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when
they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,
and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;
but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her
on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much
going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings
and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,
and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been
much in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,
and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many
more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;
and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,
had made really an agreeable fortnight.



Anne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary's face was clouded directly.
Charles laughed.



"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is
a very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.
We asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook
to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,
I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,
he made a very awkward sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had
'been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had
promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.
I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word
I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage
for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."



Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well
how it really was.  It was all your doing," (turning to Anne.)
"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:
he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered
that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,
and he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour.
Mary knows it is."



But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from
not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation
to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe
Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be
left to be guessed.  Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened
by what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,
and continued her enquiries.



"Oh! he talks of you," cried Charles, "in such terms--"
Mary interrupted him. "I declare, Charles, I never heard him
mention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,
he never talks of you at all."



"No," admitted Charles, "I do not know that he ever does, in a general
way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.
His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,
and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other
in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,
but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta
all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!
Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were
in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end
of Miss Elliot's charms."



"And I am sure," cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his credit,
if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart
is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure
you will agree with me."



"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Lady Russell, smiling.



"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
said Charles.  "Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,
and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,
he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,
you may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,
and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing;
for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would
be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;
and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.
So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."



"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,"
was Lady Russell's kind answer.



"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he is rather
my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight."



"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy
to see Captain Benwick."



"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.
He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,
sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.
He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him."



"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.  "I think Lady Russell would like him.
I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would
very soon see no deficiency in his manner."



"So do I, Anne," said Charles.  "I am sure Lady Russell would like him.
He is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will
read all day long."



"Yes, that he will!" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  "He will sit poring
over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one
drops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think
Lady Russell would like that?"



Lady Russell could not help laughing.  "Upon my word," said she,
"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have
admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact
as I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person
who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.
I wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,
you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined
not to judge him beforehand."



"You will not like him, I will answer for it."



Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation
of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.



"He is a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.
His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,
has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me."



This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short
in the midst of the Elliot countenance.



With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,
there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,
he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature
from what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;
and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her
from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,
on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week
or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going
down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick
to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick
seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.



There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both
occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.
Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might
be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence
in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,
without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.
Captain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it
than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him
a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy
of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.



The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,
bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise
of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;
but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.



Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,
when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.
Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,
nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast
as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.



Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,
whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children
from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side
was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk
and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,
bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys
were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,
which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise
of the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,
during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects
to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,
talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children
on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.



Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed
such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,
which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,
who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,
again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded
a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,
with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,
nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness
at home.



Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her
being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters
went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her
and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,
for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.



"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Lady Russell, as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross
in the Christmas holidays."



Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;
and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort
rather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,
was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through
the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,
amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,
the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless
clink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises
which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose
under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,
though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be
so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.



Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,
though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish
of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,
however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her
when she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles
of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.



Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.
Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called
a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth
and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains
to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,
as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful
if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable
curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment
she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being "a man whom she had
no wish to see."  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought
to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven
for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.



Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,
but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,
which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.



She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove
to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.






Chapter 15



Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,
a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;
and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.



Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment
of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I
leave you again?"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,
in the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister
were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,
and met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they
sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.



Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles
were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would
pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others
was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,
and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination
to listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being
deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,
they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be
all their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:
it was all Bath.



They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly
the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of,
and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,
or the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was
exceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.
They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were
perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.



Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father
and sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh
that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see
nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,
should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;
and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open
the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room
to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,
who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of
between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.



But this was not all which they had to make them happy.
They had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.
He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.
He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath
in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of
Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,
though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able
to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,
and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card
in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,
and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,
such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received
as a relation again, that their former good understanding
was completely re-established.



They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away
all the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated
in misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of
throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,
but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint
of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family
and the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted
of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,
were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.
He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct
must refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;
and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity
of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation
and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.



The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of
much extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;
but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly
respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,
Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough
Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted
to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things
relative to the marriage, which made a material difference
in the discredit of it.



Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted
also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.
She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,
accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.
There had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,
not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,
moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.
Here was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman
with a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it
as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance
in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.



Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,
evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they
gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof
of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being
on intimate terms in Camden Place.



Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,
large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.
She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant
or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had
the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,
in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,
to be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain
by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.
In all probability he was already the richer of the two,
and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.
A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,
why should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;
it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been
a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him
a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,
he might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly
very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character
might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,
and when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding
might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life
was another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish
that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth
were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,
and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent
by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits
were talked of.



Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without
being much attended to.  "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.
They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps."  They could not listen
to her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;
Sir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike
appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,
his sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament his being
very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;
nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered
almost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think
that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when
they last parted;" but Sir Walter had "not been able to return
the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean
to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,
and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere."



Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of
the whole evening.  "Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be
introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!"
and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,
as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot
spoke of her as "a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known
in Camden Place," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.
Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be
an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  "He longed to see her.
He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces
he was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was
the number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were
no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.
He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face
would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,
as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted
eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being
a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,
to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand
could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were
a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!
they were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!
It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.
He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis
(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing
that every woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be
upon Colonel Wallis."  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed
to escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting
that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure
as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.



"How is Mary looking?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.
"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not
happen every day."



"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been
in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."



"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,
and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse."



Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,
or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door
suspended everything.  "A knock at the door! and so late!
It was ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine
in Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home
to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.
Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."  Mrs Clay was right.
With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,
Mr Elliot was ushered into the room.



It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.
Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,
and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,
but "he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she
nor her friend had taken cold the day before," &amp;c. &amp;c; which was
all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part
must follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;
"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter"
(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and
blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features
which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement
at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware
of who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished
than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity
he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated
to be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking
as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,
and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,
so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them
in excellence to only one person's manners.  They were not the same,
but they were, perhaps, equally good.



He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.
There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes
were enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,
his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all
the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,
he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions
respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance
of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;
to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that
he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.
She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.
His regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole
solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,
mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,
longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion
of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.
If he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would
have told him enough.  "Well, it would serve to cure him of
an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,
which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal
of its being very ungenteel to be curious.



"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he,
"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,
are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings
in the world.  The folly of the means they often employ
is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view."



But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:
he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,
and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.



His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene
she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.
Having alluded to "an accident,"  he must hear the whole.
When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,
but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.
She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish
of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern
for what she must have suffered in witnessing it.



He staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece
had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman
was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,
before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.



Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in
Camden Place could have passed so well!






Chapter 16



There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,
would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's
being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being
in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,
when she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast
the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence
on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay
to have said, that "now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself
at all wanted;" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,
"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.
She is nothing to me, compared with you;"  and she was in full time
to hear her father say, "My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,
you have seen nothing of Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.
You must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted
with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,
I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification."



He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised
to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.
Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;
but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought
in her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,
and promise to stay.



In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be
alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;
he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,
her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been
using any thing in particular?"  "No, nothing."  "Merely Gowland,"
he supposed.  "No, nothing at all."  "Ha! he was surprised at that;"
and added, "certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;
you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,
the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been
using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.
You see how it has carried away her freckles."



If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise
might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne
that the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must
take its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,
if Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always
command a home with Lady Russell.



Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay
in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation
to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath
who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has
a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.



As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,
or more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were
an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found
the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,
as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?"
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable
or estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,
correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.
He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,
without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,
without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,
without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.
He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits
or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,
with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value
for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of
fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.
She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis
said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness
to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his
thinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot
outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.



It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she
and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;
and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell
should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require
more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.
In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,
at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,
and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,
to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process
in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring
in the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,
and at last to mention "Elizabeth."  Lady Russell listened, and looked,
and made only this cautious reply:--"Elizabeth! very well;
time will explain."



It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,
felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.
In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit
of such general observance as "Miss Elliot," that any particularity
of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,
it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.
A little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,
Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that
she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;
for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed
so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery
from the awful impression of its being dissolved.



However it might end, he was without any question their
pleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;
and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,
which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,
as herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting
a great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had
looked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;
and she remembered another person's look also.



They did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion
she perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,
it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly
into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which
she thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning
announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,
and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort
of No. --, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples
(in Anne's opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.



Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,
and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,
and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;
a wish that they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in her ears
all day long.



Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,
but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties
of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse
by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,
when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's
at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.
No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect
had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot
died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,
and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend
that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.
How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted
as cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,
in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot
thought unimportant.  "Family connexions were always worth preserving,
good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,
for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.
She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her
spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."



Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote
a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,
to his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot
could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,
in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.
"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."
The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited
in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,
and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might
be most visible:  and "Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our cousin,
Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret," were talked of to everybody.



Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been
very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation
they created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,
accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired
the name of "a charming woman," because she had a smile and a civil answer
for everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain
and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place
but for her birth.



Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet
"it was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne ventured to speak
her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing
in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,
as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,
they had their value.  Anne smiled and said,



"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,
well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;
that is what I call good company."



"You are mistaken," said he gently, "that is not good company;
that is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,
and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.
Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is
by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,
it will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.
She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin"
(sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be fastidious
than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?
Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society
of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages
of the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,
that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,
and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them
will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)
in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for."



"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"
then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,
"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken
to procure the acquaintance.  I suppose" (smiling) "I have more pride
than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be
so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may
be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."



"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.
In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,
it might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family
will always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance."



"Well," said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place."



"I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.
But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here
with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.
You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish
to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,
would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem
a little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,"
(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)
"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that
every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,
may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him."



He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been
lately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;
and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,
she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience
admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting
great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.






Chapter 17



While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their
good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance
of a very different description.



She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her
of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims
on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,
now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life
when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,
feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,
of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want
of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,
had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened
her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.



Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,
was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all
that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account
brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.



She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;
and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs
dreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort
to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted
with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,
had made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath
on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,
living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself
the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.



Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit
from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore
lost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,
or what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.
She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,
and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings
in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.



The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest
in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes
had its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone
since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person
from what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne
from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant
little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,
and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;
and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,
in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,
infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee
as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon
passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering
former partialities and talking over old times.



Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which
she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse
and be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations
of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions
of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have
closed her heart or ruined her spirits.



In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,
and Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine
a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been
very fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been
used to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her
with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement
of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.
Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom
behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without
assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,
and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.
Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had
moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation
and enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,
and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude
or of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,
a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;
here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,
that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment
which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.
It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend
as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,
it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.



There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits
had nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,
compared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,
been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,
and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again
confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;
and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having
a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit
to meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,
and could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased
her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.
She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested
attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady
had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been
particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,
a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house
when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.
"And she," said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most admirably,
has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could
use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;
and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,
pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,
and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.
She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those
who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.
She always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open,
you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,
or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke
thoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,
sensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has
a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her
infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received
'the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.
Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's
leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate
that is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one
know one's species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,
to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.
To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat."



Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,
"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,
and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.
Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!
And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be
most interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them
of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,
patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish
the worth of volumes."



"Yes," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may,
though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.
Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;
but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength
that appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience
rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.
There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately"
(speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget
to think seriously till it is almost too late."



Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been
what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind
which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.
It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,
and soon added in a different tone--



"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,
will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing
Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,
fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.
She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all
the high-priced things I have in hand now."



Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence
of such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary
to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning
from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening
in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.
They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being
kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship
which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account
with great alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening
with an old schoolfellow."  They were not much interested in anything
relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,
to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth
was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.



"Westgate Buildings!" said he, "and who is Miss Anne Elliot
to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;
and who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names
are to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?
That she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,
you have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts
other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations
are inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady
till to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,
but that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?"



"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can
put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time
which will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath
to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."



"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" asked Elizabeth.



"She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary,
she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have
called on Mrs Smith."



"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sir Walter.
"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,
but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known
to convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!
A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;
a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names
in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,
and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility
of England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!"



Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it
advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,
and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's
not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect
to her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it
to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow
in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,
and no surname of dignity.



Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course
she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.
She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter
and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,
but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,
and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;
and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,
and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements
in order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that
such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,
its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of
between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,
and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.
Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,
sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.
He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,
mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell
in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand
so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated
by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations
which her friend meant to create.



Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.
She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of
his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks
which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,
and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.
She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,
she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,
of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,
supposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,
and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,
and gently shook her head.



"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Lady Russell,
"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events
and calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence
pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,
I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.
A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think
it might be a very happy one."



"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects
I think highly of him," said Anne; "but we should not suit."



Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that
to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,
the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying
your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights,
and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be
the highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother's self
in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you
such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing
in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!
My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt
at my time of life!"



Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,
and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart
were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;
of having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" first revived in herself;
of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,
her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.
Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter
to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment
with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,
what Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking
for himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch
and of "Lady Elliot" all faded away.  She never could accept him.
And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man
save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities
of such a case, was against Mr Elliot.



Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied
that she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,
an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,
seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all
clear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix
on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would
have been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,
if not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt
of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,
suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.
She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling
had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life
(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,
careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think
very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,
cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?
How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?



Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.
There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,
at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.
Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,
the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.
Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could
so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked
or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.



Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers
in her father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,
stood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some
degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see
what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet
Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.



Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,
for she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine
a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she
ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive
the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of
the following autumn.






Chapter 18



It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,
was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.
It was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew
that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be
recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all
very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary
was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,
with Admiral and Mrs Croft's compliments.



The Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.
They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.



"What is this?" cried Sir Walter.  "The Crofts have arrived in Bath?
The Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?"



"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."



"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.
I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.
I know what is due to my tenant."



Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how
the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.
It had been begun several days back.





"February 1st.



"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know
how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.
You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,
as you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had
a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party
all the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.
The holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had
such long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,
except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear
they have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother
to part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are
not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to
like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.
What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,
with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.
I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,
except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.
Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme
as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.
The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.
We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,
Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,
which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.
I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted
with him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way
when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family
to be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying
with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps
if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.
Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children
to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,
for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts
are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.
Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility
to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.
I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,
and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me
in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,



"Mary M---.



"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has
just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat
very much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,
you know, are always worse than anybody's."





So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,
containing nearly as much more.





"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa
bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal
to add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,
offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,
addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to
make my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,
and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.
I shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood
cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.
I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.
She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening
we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised
not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited
as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?
Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,
and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer
from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her
before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.
True, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised
at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.
Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.
We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her
marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;
and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick
is expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal
on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite
with both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her
the better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth
will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;
I never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,
of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.
How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always
incomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.
Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better
than marrying among the Hayters."





Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared
for the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.
Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful
for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain
in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions
of the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter
wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,
and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath
as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had
little curiosity beyond.



"How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,
"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?"



"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty."



"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sir Walter.  "Poor old gentleman."



"Have they any acquaintance here?" asked Elizabeth.



"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's
time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance
in such a place as this."



"I suspect," said Sir Walter coolly, "that Admiral Croft
will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.
Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?"



"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance
she might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;
but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.
We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.
There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,
I am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them."



This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;
when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,
in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,
Anne was at liberty.



In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder
how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,
had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.
She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything
akin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure
that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.



Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,
joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,
feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything
that would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!
Where could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.
It had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;
they had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta's
coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,
and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,
and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne
had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing
the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,
they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some
dawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,
to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary
might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing
young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have
received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.
He must love somebody.



She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine
naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.
He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast
for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;
of course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of
Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,
and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt
of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,
might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to
the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have
influenced her fate.



The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible
of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man,
there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;
and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing
to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart
beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks
when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.
They were too much like joy, senseless joy!



She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,
it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.
The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove
was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.



The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,
perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed
of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more
about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.



The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,
and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.
They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.
He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft
seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk
for her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.
Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,
and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.
Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture
of happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,
delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,
as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted
to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered
an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.



Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;
but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days
after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,
or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town,
and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street
she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing
by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,
in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have
passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him
before she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and
acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness
and good humour.  "Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.
This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,
staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.
But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.
Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,
to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen
stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks
and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,
which they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!"
(laughing heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.
Well," (turning away), "now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere
for you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?"



"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company
the little way our road lies together.  I am going home."





"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes
we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you
as we go along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not
feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!"
taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.



"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?"



"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;
I shall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.
'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.
She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,
as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,
you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,
both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.
Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:
got away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story
another time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.
Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.
Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!
How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.
We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets
full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;
and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,
and draw in our chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch,
ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.
We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,
for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.
The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way."



When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again
for what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street
to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,
for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had
gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was
not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.
As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--



"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.
But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady
I am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have
all been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been
happening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name."



Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
did; but now she could safely suggest the name of "Louisa."



"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out
if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,
this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.
He was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,
what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;
then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain
was set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their
way of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,
and then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead
he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since.
We have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could
not understand it.  But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all;
for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being
to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick."



"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."



"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,
for I do not know what they should wait for."



"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man," said Anne,
"and I understand that he bears an excellent character."



"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.
He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are
bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.
An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,
zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,
for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice."



"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit
from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,
and I will answer for it, they would generally please."



"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too
piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,
Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.
There is something about Frederick more to our taste."



Anne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea
of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,
not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best
that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,
she was beginning to say, "I was not entering into any comparison
of the two friends," but the Admiral interrupted her with--



"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.
We have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter
from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it
in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.
I fancy they are all at Uppercross."



This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,
"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain
Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.
It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him
and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out
on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter
does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man."



"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur
from beginning to end."



Anne looked down to hide her smile.



"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has
too much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,
it is very fit she should have him."



"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing
in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose
he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,
you know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry
that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick
should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."



"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that nature
in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;
does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own
for wondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,
that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.
He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that, I think."



Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant
to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.
She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet
attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.



"Poor Frederick!" said he at last.  "Now he must begin all over again
with somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,
and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.
It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other
Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.
Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?"






Chapter 19



While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing
his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth
was already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,
he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.



Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were
in Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to
make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it
very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being
conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting
at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,
turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,
to request her assistance.  He soon joined them again, successful,
of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,
and would call for them in a few minutes.



Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold
more than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;
consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation
for all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt
as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,
but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility
between the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was
most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also
a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,
and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;
and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left
to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them
with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were
obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay
had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,
that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the thickest.



It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party
in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,
as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,
Captain Wentworth walking down the street.



Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that
she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable
and absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;
it was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded
back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,
and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street
on a commission of Mrs Clay's.



She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;
she wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself
of another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.
She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always
so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other
of being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.
She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of
Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,
evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined
a little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck
and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;
he looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,
she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.
She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.
All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects
of strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,
she had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,
a something between delight and misery.



He spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner
was embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,
or anything so certainly as embarrassed.



After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,
much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible
of his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being
so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.
Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness
of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been
suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look
of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was
Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.



It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth
would not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,
that there was complete internal recognition on each side;
she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,
expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away
with unalterable coldness.



Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing
very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.
It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,
and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd
in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey
Miss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but
by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;
and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,
and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.



"I am much obliged to you," was her answer, "but I am not going with them.
The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking."



"But it rains."



"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard."



After a moment's pause he said:  "Though I came only yesterday,
I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,"
(pointing to a new umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it,
if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent
to let me get you a chair."



She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating
her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,
and adding, "I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,
I am sure."



She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.
Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference
between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,
admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner
of the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,
appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,
was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away
without further loss of time and before the rain increased;
and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,
a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a "Good morning to you!"
being all that she had time for, as she passed away.



As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party
began talking of them.



"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?"



"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.
He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.
What a very good-looking man!"



"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,
says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with."



"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes
to look at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess
I admire her more than her sister."



"Oh! so do I."



"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.
Anne is too delicate for them."



Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have
walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.
She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing
could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting:
praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,
and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now
she could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand
his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much
from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,
she could not be quite herself.



She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.



Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long
he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not
recollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable
that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was
to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood
see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?



She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove
was to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounter
Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance
to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge
of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.



The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,
in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,
in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him
on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view
the greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,
many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.
She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea
of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was
not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they
were nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,
anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,
though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew
was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of
Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--of
her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly
comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's mind,
the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment
she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,
and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him
of one personal grace!



At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  "Now, how would she
speak of him?"



"You will wonder," said she, "what has been fixing my eye so long;
but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and
Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described
the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this
side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest
and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,
and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess
I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description."



Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,
either at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,
was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have
lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.



A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,
where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough
for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the
elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting
more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,
sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because
her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.
It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.
Of course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,
and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have
a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should
be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,
Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened
by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.



She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,
with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.
Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.



"By all means," said she; "only tell me all about it, when you do come.
Who is your party?"



Anne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was
leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,
"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me
to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding
that I may not have many more visits from you."



Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense,
was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.






Chapter 20



Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest
of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple
must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires
in the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door
opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was
the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.
He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle "How do you do?"
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries
in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.
Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing
of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed
right to be done.



While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth
caught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;
and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended
that her father had judged so well as to give him that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time
by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.
This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet
better than nothing, and her spirits improved.



After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,
their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,
that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;
he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,
with a little smile, a little glow, he said--



"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have
suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you
at the time."



She assured him that she had not.



"It was a frightful hour," said he, "a frightful day!" and he
passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still
too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,
"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences
which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.
When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be
the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea
of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery."



"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be
a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles
and good temper."



"Yes," said he, looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think,
ends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice
over every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties
to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.
The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort.
All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;
more than perhaps--"



He stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him
some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks
and fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,
he proceeded thus--



"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,
and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove
as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,
but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;
and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her
with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,
had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,
it would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,
untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,
in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!
Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her
was indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such
a devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not."



Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,
or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,
in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,
and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless
slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,
had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,
and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things
in a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;
and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,
and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated
so far as to say--



"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"



"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well
was quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief
to be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.
She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.
The country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;
and the more I saw, the more I found to admire."



"I should very much like to see Lyme again," said Anne.



"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found
anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress
you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!
I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been
strong disgust."



"The last hours were certainly very painful," replied Anne;
"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.
One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,
unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was
by no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress
during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal
of enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,
that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty
at Lyme; and in short" (with a faint blush at some recollections),
"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable."



As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared
for whom they were waiting.  "Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,"
was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible
with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward
to meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot
and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,
advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was
a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.
She was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,
almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,
but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!
She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings
towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;
and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful
civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.
She was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which
disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,
as being less happy than herself.



The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back
from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw
that he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into
the Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt
a moment's regret.  But "they should meet again.  He would look for her,
he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,
perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of
a little interval for recollection."



Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party
was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,
and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence
in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,
and disturb as many people as they could.



Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back
of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for
which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be
an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison
between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,
of the other all generous attachment.



Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.
Her happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;
but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of
the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took
a hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,
and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see
in only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,
an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder
at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;
sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes
and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had
a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,
were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship
and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of
the tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change
as implying less.  He must love her.



These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied
and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,
without even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,
and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;
her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,
she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.



The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:
Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,
with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.
Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object
of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.



Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment
of the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for
the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,
and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,
at least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,
in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained
the words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.



"This," said she, "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,
for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,
but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend
to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar."



"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.
You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight
these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,
comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more
of your ignorance.  Here is complete proof."



"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient."



"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,"
replied he, "without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;
and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general
to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished
for modesty to be natural in any other woman."



"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are
to have next," turning to the bill.



"Perhaps," said Mr Elliot, speaking low, "I have had a longer acquaintance
with your character than you are aware of."



"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since
I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of
in my own family."



"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted
with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,
accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."



Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.
No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been
described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,
is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,
and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,
but he would not tell.



"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention
no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.
He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot
as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited
the warmest curiosity to know her."



Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with
partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,
Captain Wentworth's brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company,
but she had not courage to ask the question.



"The name of Anne Elliot," said he, "has long had an interesting sound to me.
Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,
I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."



Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she
received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds
immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.
Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.



"A well-looking man," said Sir Walter, "a very well-looking man."



"A very fine young man indeed!" said Lady Dalrymple.  "More air
than one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say."



"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;
Captain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant
in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch."



Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught
the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing
among a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,
his seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.
It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she
dared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance
was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention
to the orchestra and look straight forward.



When she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have
come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:
but she would rather have caught his eye.



Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer
any inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.



The first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;
and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them
did decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who
did not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;
but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,
whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from
conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.
She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.



He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him
at a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval
wore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,
benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure
or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give
delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.
To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.
She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth
once more, without the interchange of one friendly look.



In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which
was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,
and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner
not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,
and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,
much more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,
without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;
but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;
though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication
in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench
before the concert closed.



Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth
was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;
yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees
came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something
must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference
between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room
was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,
of Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?
He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain
Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;
and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.
Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,
and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance
improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked
for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down
towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.
It came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,
to explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have
a general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;
but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.



A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;
and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look
as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,
in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  "He must wish her good night;
he was going; he should get home as fast as he could."



"Is not this song worth staying for?" said Anne, suddenly struck
by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.



"No!" he replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;"
and he was gone directly.



Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.
Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it
a week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.
But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.
How was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?
How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,
would he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think
of Mr Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.






Chapter 21



Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise
of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home
at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid
Mr Elliot was almost a first object.



She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of
the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,
perhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which
he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,
by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether
very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.
How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,
was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;
and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,
her affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,
could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.



Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,
could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne
was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.
It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.



She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning
particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,
though it had been an appointment.



An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections
of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features
and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell
she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,
and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had
already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening
than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars
of the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath
was well know by name to Mrs Smith.



"The little Durands were there, I conclude," said she, "with their mouths
open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.
They never miss a concert."



"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were
in the room."



"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,
with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them."



"I do not know.  I do not think they were."



"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,
I know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;
for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,
round the orchestra, of course."



"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses
to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,
for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen
very little."



"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.
There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,
and this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,
and you wanted nothing beyond."



"But I ought to have looked about me more," said Anne, conscious
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,
that the object only had been deficient.



"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you
had a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see
how the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable
to listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation."



Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"



"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were
in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable
in the world, the person who interests you at this present time
more than all the rest of the world put together."



A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.



"And such being the case," continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,
"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness
in coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you
to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands
upon your time."



Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine
how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.
After another short silence--



"Pray," said Mrs Smith, "is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?
Does he know that I am in Bath?"



"Mr Elliot!" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's reflection
shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;
and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,
more composedly, "Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?"



"I have been a good deal acquainted with him," replied Mrs Smith, gravely,
"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met."



"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.
Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you."



"To confess the truth," said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual
air of cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.
I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.
He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,
my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,
of course it is done."



"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness
to be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anne; "but I suspect
that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,
a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.
I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.
You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.  If in that light
there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,
I beg you would not hesitate to employ me."



Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--



"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.
I ought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear
Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.
Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to
think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on
Mr Elliot's good fortune."



"No," replied Anne, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.
I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of
will be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.
I should like to know why you imagine I am?"



Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,
shook her head, and exclaimed--



"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew
what you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,
when the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,
we women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,
that every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?
Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for
my former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?
Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?
Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him
from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?"



"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above
half a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses
to any one."



"Oh! if these are your only objections," cried Mrs Smith, archly,
"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.
Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to be
a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,
which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements
of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.
Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,
he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,
I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,
and safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be
misled by others to his ruin."



"No," said Anne, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.
He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open
to dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.
I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,
to do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,
I think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner
of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?
Surely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.
Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine
he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you
I shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which
you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert
of last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--"



She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;
but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly
have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception
of there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,
eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith
should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have
received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.



"Do tell me how it first came into your head."



"It first came into my head," replied Mrs Smith, "upon finding how much
you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing
in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you
in the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago."



"And has it indeed been spoken of?"



"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when
you called yesterday?"



"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed
no one in particular."



"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,
had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way
to let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;
and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.
She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.
She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history."
"The whole history," repeated Anne, laughing.  "She could not make
a very long history, I think, of one such little article
of unfounded news."



Mrs Smith said nothing.



"But," continued Anne, presently, "though there is no truth in my having
this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you
in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?
Shall I take any message?"



"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,
and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured
to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,
I have nothing to trouble you with."



"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?"



"I did."



"Not before he was married, I suppose?"



"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first."



"And--were you much acquainted?"



"Intimately."



"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.
I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.
Was he at all such as he appears now?"



"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years," was Mrs Smith's answer,
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;
and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.
They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--



"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, in her
natural tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers
I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.
I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.
There were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates
to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.
Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,
though there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;
I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted
with Mr Elliot's real character.  Though I fully believe that,
at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,
there is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,
be differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,
now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart
or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks
only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty
of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without
risk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.
Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.
He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.
Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!"



Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,
and in a calmer manner, she added,



"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.
But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.
I will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.
He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,
and thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed
before our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,
became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained
the highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not
think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,
and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost
always together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.
He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;
he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do
to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home
with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.
My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,
would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse
was open to him; I know that he often assisted him."



"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,"
said Anne, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.
It must have been about the same time that he became known to
my father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;
but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to
my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,
which I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed
to announce a different sort of man."



"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Smith.  "He had been
introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,
but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited
and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,
perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,
I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;
I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though
I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,
indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,
or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer
any question you may wish to put."



"Nay," said Anne, "I have no particular enquiry to make about her.
I have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should
like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight
my father's acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed
to take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?"



"Mr Elliot," replied Mrs Smith, "at that period of his life,
had one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker
process than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.
He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;
and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course
I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities
and invitations, were designing a match between the heir
and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match
should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.
That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.
He told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.
It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,
my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;
and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father
and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought
very affectionately of the other."



"Perhaps," cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes
spoke of me to Mr Elliot?"



"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,
and vouch for your being a very different creature from--"



She checked herself just in time.



"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,"
cried Anne.  "This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.
I could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where
dear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;
I have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes
to his character."



Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.  "Oh! those things are too common.
When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money
is too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,
and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,
gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.
I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me
other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible
in what Mr Elliot was doing.  'To do the best for himself,'
passed as a duty."



"But was not she a very low woman?"



"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,
was all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather
had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,
had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,
thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;
and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,
with respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured
of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.
Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation
in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.
His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour
of the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,
that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his
for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;
but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say
on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,
for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof."



"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none," cried Anne.  "You have asserted
nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.
This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.
I am more curious to know why he should be so different now."



"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;
stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."



Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.
The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it
as she unlocked it, said--



"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;
a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him
before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.
But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;
and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others
still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,
while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.
Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little
satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document
of former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad
that I can produce it."



This was the letter, directed to "Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,"
and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--



"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.
I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have
lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.
At present, believe me, I have no need of your services,
being in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.
They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them
this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,
to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.
The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;
he is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,
which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse
than last year.



"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter
I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me
with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,
to be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot."



Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;
and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--



"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.
But it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.
Can any thing be stronger?"



Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification
of finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,
that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,
that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,
before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter
which she had been meditating over, and say--



"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing
you were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?"



"I can explain this too," cried Mrs Smith, smiling.



"Can you really?"



"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,
and I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,
but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what
he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.
He truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family
are very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:
his friend Colonel Wallis."



"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?"



"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;
it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream
is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings
is easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis
of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,
in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;
but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom
he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.
She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all
to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,
very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend
Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.
When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was
not romancing so much as you supposed."



"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.
Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account
for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.
That was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on
the most friendly terms when I arrived."



"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"



"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information
in such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands
of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,
can hardly have much truth left."



"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of
the general credit due, by listening to some particulars
which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.
Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you
indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without
knowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?
Did he see you last summer or autumn, 'somewhere down in the west,'
to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?"



"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.
I happened to be at Lyme."



"Well," continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, "grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then
at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased
to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,
and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive
in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,
which I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know
to be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,
that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,
whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter
as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),
and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,
handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation
and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance,
of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise
that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger."



Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,
and she continued--



"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye
upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then
visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest
in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath
for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,
and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,
that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions
as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion
he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money
as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice
or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness
upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on
before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.
He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,
therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be
very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution
of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here
for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,
and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means
of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady
if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends
as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist
in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis
was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.
Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,
as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was
his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival
added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.
He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,
called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.
You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,
perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do."



"Yes," said Anne, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with
what I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive
in the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.
I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,
who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.
I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.
I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability
of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger
to be lessening or not."



"Lessening, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.  "He thinks Mrs Clay
afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed
as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent
some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure
while she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,
as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles
when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.
A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;
but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure,
ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'
And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,
is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.
She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;
and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have
some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through
Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"



"I am very glad to know all this," said Anne, after a little
thoughtfulness.  "It will be more painful to me in some respects
to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.
My line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently
a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had
any better principle to guide him than selfishness."



But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away
from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest
of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied
against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation
of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,
if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,
proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;
very deficient both in justice and compassion.



She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired
by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together,
and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.
Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender
of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.
From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been
a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,
led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by
his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification
of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,
(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),
and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself
to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths
accordingly had been ruined.



The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.
They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship
of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs
was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had
appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such
as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.



Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to
urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same
stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,
under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference
to any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture
of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,
that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal
to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae
of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been
merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.
Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only
the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's
usual state of mind.



There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances
of particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that
some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been
for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment
of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;
and this property, though not large, would be enough to make
her comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.
Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,
equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of
bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.
She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,
and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.
This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.
To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,
that a little trouble in the right place might do it,
and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,
was hard to bear.



It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices
with Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation
of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;
but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,
since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,
that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman
he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,
as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,
when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed
the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope
of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least
the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.



After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but
express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably
in the beginning of their conversation.  "She had seemed to recommend
and praise him!"



"My dear," was Mrs Smith's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.
I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet
have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,
than if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,
as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,
and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.
He was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.
I was willing to hope that you must fare better."



Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility
of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea
of the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that
she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such
a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had
disclosed all, too late?



It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,
which carried them through the greater part of the morning,
was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend
everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.






Chapter 22



Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,
her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.
There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as
opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;
and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief
he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.
Pity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.
In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned
for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;
for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,
and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing
how to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own
knowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward
for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was
a reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her
what no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have
been extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.
She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,
and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure
as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be
in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;
in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.





She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,
escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them
a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,
and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.



"I had not the smallest intention of asking him," said Elizabeth,
with affected carelessness, "but he gave so many hints;
so Mrs Clay says, at least."



"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder
for an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;
for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty."



"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I have been rather too much used to the game
to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found
how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father
this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit
an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to
so much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.
Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect."



"Quite delightful!" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,
to turn her eyes towards Anne.  "Exactly like father and son!
Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?"



"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such
ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions
being beyond those of other men."



"My dear Miss Elliot!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.



"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.
I did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.
When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park
for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him."



Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew
such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival
of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with
her prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate
the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,
placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license
of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have
done otherwise.



To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;
and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.
She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,
but now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference
to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;
and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,
she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,
or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.



She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke
a remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape
all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool
to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,
as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,
and more cool, than she had been the night before.



He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where
he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much
to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:
he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary
to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was
not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard
among the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised
that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,
bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct
which were least excusable.



She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath
the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part
of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of
his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.
It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;
but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,
seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.
It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised
on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources
of mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was
not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded
for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.



On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,
and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone
directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out
on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which
determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.
She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk
of spending the morning in Rivers Street.



"Very well," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my love.
Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,
and pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself
for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.
Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.
You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.
I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her
at the concert.  Something so formal and arrangé in her air!
and she sits so upright!  My best love, of course."



"And mine," added Sir Walter.  "Kindest regards.  And you may say,
that I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;
but I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair
by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.
If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;
but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately."



While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?
Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,
would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.
After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,
and "Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove" were ushered into the room.



Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;
but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon
as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived
with any views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth
were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.
They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were
at the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;
but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into
the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,
Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history
of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints
of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,
as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.



She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,
and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,
intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw
a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme
had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to
come to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;
and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed
coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it
very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear
to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two
everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,
it had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had
some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought
a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes
for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being
his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy
to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it
by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.
Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with
Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.



Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined
such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent
the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,
very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter
had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth
who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that
on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty
of something more permanent long before the term in question,
the two families had consented to the young people's wishes,
and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,
quite as soon as Louisa's.  "And a very good living it was,"
Charles added:  "only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,
and in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.
In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,
surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous
than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get
a special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,"
he observed, "Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him."



"I am extremely glad, indeed," cried Anne, "particularly glad
that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve
equally well, and who have always been such good friends,
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the
other--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.
I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both."



"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,
but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with
money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,
and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say
they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have
daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,
liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.
She never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,
nor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to
the value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;
and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now."



"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,
"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything
to confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people
to be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free
from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct
and misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa
perfectly recovered now?"



He answered rather hesitatingly, "Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;
but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing
or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door
a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;
and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,
all day long."



Anne could not help laughing.  "That cannot be much to your taste,
I know," said she; "but I do believe him to be an excellent young man."



"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think
I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can
but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him
no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.
I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.
We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in
my father's great barns; and he played his part so well
that I have liked him the better ever since."



Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's
following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had
heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,
and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,
her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly
have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want
to lessen theirs.



The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was
in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,
and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage
with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,
that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,
and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,
as they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,
and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing-rooms.



Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.
She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked
to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,
the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those
who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.
It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,
and then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:
"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess
to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;
did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:
and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;
put her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;
she cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;
that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.
They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted
to come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,
but most elegant."  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation
was given to the two present, and promised for the absent,
Mary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked
to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,
who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not
have received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have
the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;
and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her
and Henrietta directly.



Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;
but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,
to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,
with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.



They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,
and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly
in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,
which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had
ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won
by her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,
and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,
from the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated
to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day
and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,
she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,
and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's
history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions
on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help
which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;
from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying
to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,
well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window
overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have
her moments of imagining.



A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party
in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes
brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there
half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,
seemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends
were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with
Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter
could not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible
for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their
common friends must be soon bringing them together again.
Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;
she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared
from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had
hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.
He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.



She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,
and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--"Surely,
if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts
must understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,
to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence,
and wantonly playing with our own happiness."  And yet,
a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company
with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be
exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most
mischievous kind.



"Anne," cried Mary, still at her window, "there is Mrs Clay,
I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed
deep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.
It is Mr Elliot himself."



"No," cried Anne, quickly, "it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.
He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back
till to-morrow."



As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,
the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret
that she had said so much, simple as it was.



Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,
began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting
still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne
to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,
and tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,
however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between
two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves
quite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her
had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure
that it would now spread farther.



"Do come, Anne," cried Mary, "come and look yourself.  You will be too late
if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.
He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have
forgot all about Lyme."



To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,
Anne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain
that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,
before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off
on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel
at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons
of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, "Yes, it is Mr Elliot,
certainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,
or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;" and walked back to her chair,
recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.



The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,
and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--



"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.
I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.
A'n't I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.
It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will
not be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.
Have not I done well, mother?"



Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness
for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary
eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--



"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?
Take a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged
to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked
to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all
the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?
How can you be so forgetful?"



"Phoo! phoo!" replied Charles, "what's an evening party?
Never worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,
I think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,
but I shall go to the play."



"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,
when you promised to go."



"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word
'happy.'  There was no promise."



"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.
We were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always
such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.
Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.
We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,
whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention
is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father's heir:  the future
representative of the family."



"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charles.
"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow
to the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,
I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.
What is Mr Elliot to me?"  The careless expression was life to Anne,
who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and
listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought
his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.



Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious
and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,
invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting
to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,
she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play
without her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.



"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back
and change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,
and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;
and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,
if Miss Anne could not be with us."



Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much
so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--



"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home
(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.
I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy
to change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better
not be attempted, perhaps."  She had spoken it; but she trembled
when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,
and daring not even to try to observe their effect.



It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;
Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,
by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.



Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;
probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,
and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.



"You have not been long enough in Bath," said he, "to enjoy
the evening parties of the place."



"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.
I am no card-player."



"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;
but time makes many changes."



"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she
hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments
he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,
"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period."



Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds
he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,
eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,
and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else
should come in.



They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,
and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known
the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,
in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own
sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,
wherewith to pity her.



Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds
were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open
for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give
a general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked
saw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety
of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,
or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.
How mortifying to feel that it was so!



Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth
was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.
She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.
Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel
explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying
the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which
was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.
"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party."
It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had
provided herself, the "Miss Elliot at home," were laid on the table,
with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and
one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,
that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.
The past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth
would move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,
and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.



The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,
but not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had
with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which
it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather
than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.
She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe
that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement
for all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card
in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.



"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!" whispered Mary
very audibly.  "I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!
You see he cannot put the card out of his hand."



Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.



The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,
the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while
Anne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,
and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been
so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,
and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent
as she chose.



Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,
she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,
there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements
of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration
of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all
the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant
of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending
question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were
reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude
never appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought
he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case
which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,
as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.



She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,
to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot
three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,
for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview
from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her
there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.  It was transient:
cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there
the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,
or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend
(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs
on Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable
imitation of nature:--



"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise
I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.
He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented
setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;
for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer
for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.
He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.
He was full of 'to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been
full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension
of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have
gone so entirely out of my head."






Chapter 23



One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith;
but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched
by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,
that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer
her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be
with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,
and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head,
must live another day.



She could not keep her appointment punctually, however;
the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain
on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own,
before she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,
and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself
neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.
The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,
and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard
that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment
it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest
injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there
till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,
be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once
in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of
tasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,
no waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,
or the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after
her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--



"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,
if you will give me materials."



Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,
and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.



Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest
daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice
which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.
Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,
as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,
she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,
"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again
to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,
and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred
to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what
I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded
to think might do very well," and a great deal in the same style
of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage
of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,
could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft
was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,
it was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be
too much self-occupied to hear.



"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered," said Mrs Musgrove,
in her powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different,
yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,
for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was
pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,
and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.
At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement."



"That is precisely what I was going to observe," cried Mrs Croft.
"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,
and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be
involved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--"



"Oh! dear Mrs Croft," cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her
finish her speech, "there is nothing I so abominate for young people
as a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against
for my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people
to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry
in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--"



"Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement,
an engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing
that at such a time there will be the means of marrying,
I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents
should prevent as far as they can."



Anne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application
to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,
listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,
one quick, conscious look at her.



The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of
a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,
but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,
her mind was in confusion.



Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,
now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,
though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible
that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her
with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,
"Come to me, I have something to say;" and the unaffected,
easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance
than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself
and went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end
of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer
to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him,
Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful
expression which seemed its natural character.



"Look here," said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying
a small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"



"Certainly:  Captain Benwick."



"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But," (in a deep tone,)
"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our
walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought
then--but no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with
a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise
to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;
and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!
It was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?
I hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it
over to another.  He undertakes it;" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)
"he is writing about it now."  And with a quivering lip he wound up
the whole by adding, "Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!"



"No," replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. "That I can easily believe."



"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him."



"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."



Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that
for your sex?" and she answered the question, smiling also,
"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.
It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.
We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.
You are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,
business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,
and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."



"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply
to Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace
turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,
in our little family circle, ever since."



"True," said Anne, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall
we say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from
outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,
man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick."



"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more
man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love,
or have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are
the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,
and riding out the heaviest weather."



"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anne, "but the same spirit
of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.
Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.
Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.
You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.
You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.
Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,
nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed"
(with a faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be
added to all this."



"We shall never agree upon this question," Captain Harville
was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention
to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.
It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was
startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined
to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been
occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think
he could have caught.



"Have you finished your letter?" said Captain Harville.



"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes."



"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.
I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at Anne,) "well supplied,
and want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,"
(lowering his voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree,
I suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.
But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,
prose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you
fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think
I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say
upon woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk
of woman's fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all
written by men."



"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples
in books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.
Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has
been in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything."



"But how shall we prove anything?"



"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.
It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.
We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;
and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it
which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances
(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such
as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,
or in some respect saying what should not be said."



"Ah!" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,
"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes
a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat
that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,
and then turns away and says, 'God knows whether we ever meet again!'
And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does
see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence,
perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon
it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,
and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while
hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,
as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!
If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,
and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!
I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!" pressing his own
with emotion.



"Oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,
and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!
I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment
and constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable
of everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal
to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,
so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have
an object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.
All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;
you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence
or when hope is gone."



She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart
was too full, her breath too much oppressed.



"You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his hand
on her arm, quite affectionately.  "There is no quarrelling with you.
And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied."



Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.



"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe," said she.
"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.
To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,"
(turning to Anne.)  "We had your sister's card yesterday,
and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;
and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?"



Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either
could not or would not answer fully.



"Yes," said he, "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I
shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,
I am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.
I shall be at your service in half a minute."



Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter
with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,
agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how
to understand it.  She had the kindest "Good morning, God bless you!"
from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!
He had passed out of the room without a look!



She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where
he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;
the door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,
but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room
to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,
placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her
for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,
almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:
the work of an instant!



The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost
beyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,
to "Miss A. E.--," was evidently the one which he had been folding
so hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,
he had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter
depended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,
anything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had
little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection
she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,
succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,
her eyes devoured the following words:





"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,
half hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings
are gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart
even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years
and a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,
that his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.
Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,
but never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.
For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?
Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even
these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have
penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing
something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.
Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.
You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.
Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.



"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,
or follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,
will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house
this evening or never."





Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour's solitude
and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only
which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints
of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment
rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.
And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,
Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.



The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then
an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.
She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged
to plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see
that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not
stir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only
have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room
it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or
waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,
she said she would go home.



"By all means, my dear," cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly,
and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.
I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.
Charles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk."



But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility
of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,
solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)
could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,
and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,
having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall
in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,
and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having
had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on
finding her better at night.



Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--



"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.
Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope
to see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been
some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville
and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."



"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.
Captain Harville has no thought but of going."



"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.
Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?
You will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me."



"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville
anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed, my dear,
you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,
I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say."



Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance
to damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,
however.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,
it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence
by Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.
Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;
there was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not
be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,
to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling
but gratitude apparent.



They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something
of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight
of Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute
whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.
Anne could command herself enough to receive that look,
and not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,
and the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.
Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--



"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,
or farther up the town?"



"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.



"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?
Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you
to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.
She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,
and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.
He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;
said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,
that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.
By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,
which you shot with one day round Winthrop."



There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most
proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;
and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.
In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,
and the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed
between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet
and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make
the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all
the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives
could bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,
but which had been followed by so many, many years of division
and estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,
more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when
it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed
in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;
more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly
paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,
seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,
flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in
those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little
variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday
and today there could scarcely be an end.



She had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been
the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate
in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,
after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him
in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,
in the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding
to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions
occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by
those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked
with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which
he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.



Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.
He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.
He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed
he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,
nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it
to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only
been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been
a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind
as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude
and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross
had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun
to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons
of more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot
had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at
Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.



In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove
(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever
felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,
for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection
which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence
of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison,
or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.
There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle
and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness
and the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun
to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.



From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner
been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days
of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,
than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.



"I found," said he, "that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!
That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our
mutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,
I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect
that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,
perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour
if she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously
on this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy
must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had
no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,
at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other
ill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."



He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;
and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring
for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,
if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.
It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.
He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or
speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,
to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,
and act as circumstances might require.



"I was six weeks with Edward," said he, "and saw him happy.
I could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you
very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,
little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."



Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder
for a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,
in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm
of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased
to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be
the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.



He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,
and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa
by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement
with Benwick.



"Here," said he, "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least
put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;
I could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,
and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first
five minutes I said, 'I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.
Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive
with some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that
you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement
happened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and
sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,
at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help
often saying, 'Was this for me?'"



Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,
but the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up
of exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward
in the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing
and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,
marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on
with energy.



"To see you," cried he, "in the midst of those who could not be
my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope
to influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,
to consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough
to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on
without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,
was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,
the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once
done--was it not all against me?"



"You should have distinguished," replied Anne.  "You should not have
suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that
it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.
When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called
in aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk
would have been incurred, and all duty violated."



"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus," he replied, "but I could not.
I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired
of your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under
year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,
who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.
I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit
was to be added."



"I should have thought," said Anne, "that my manner to yourself
might have spared you much or all of this."



"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement
to another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,
I was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,
and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."



At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,
she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy
in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.
An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective
of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went
to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness
of her enjoyment.



The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.
It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had
never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,
too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found
an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,
and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,
she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.
Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.
The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.
She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in
the public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,
there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,
the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,
attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;
with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and
fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;
and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications
continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always
the knowledge of his being there.



It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied
in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--



"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially
to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;
and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,
that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom
you will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place
of a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying
that she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases
in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;
and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance
of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right
in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have
suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,
because I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,
as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing
to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty
is no bad part of a woman's portion."



He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,
replied, as if in cool deliberation--



"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.
I trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been
thinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,
whether there may not have been one person more my enemy
even than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned
to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,
and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,
would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,
have renewed the engagement then?"



"Would I!" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.



"Good God!" he cried, "you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,
or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;
but I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.
I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.
This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one
sooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering
might have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.
I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn
every blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils
and just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses," he added,
with a smile. "I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.
I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve."






Chapter 24



Who can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people
take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance
to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,
or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.
This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;
and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and
an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,
consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,
fail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,
have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was
little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.
Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse
than look cold and unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty
thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity
could place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy
to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,
who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself
in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could
give his daughter at present but a small part of the share
of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.



Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,
and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,
was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,
when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,
and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,
and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced
against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by
his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,
with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage
in the volume of honour.



The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite
any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell
must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,
and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,
and do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what
Lady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had
been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced
by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners
had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them
to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because
Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety
and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been
too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct
opinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less
for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been
pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions
and of hopes.



There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment
of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience
in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted
in this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was
a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible
and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne
better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness
of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself
as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.



Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,
and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental
to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;
and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters,
it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than
either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,
perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored
to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;
but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.
Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,
no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth
from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.



It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied
with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.
She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,
and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise
even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.



The news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot
most unexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,
his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness
which a son-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited
and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest
and his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's
quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established
under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game
he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself
from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.



Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,
for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer
for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;
and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,
may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being
the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last
into making her the wife of Sir William.



It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked
and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of
their deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,
to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter
and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,
is but a state of half enjoyment.



Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning
to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy
to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness
of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.
There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion
in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret;
but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,
nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her
in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain
as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise
strong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,
Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed
to attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,
he could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say
that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,
he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,
and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her
quickly and permanently.



Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,
and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,
secured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;
and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering
her husband's property in the West Indies, by writing for her,
acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties
of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man
and a determined friend, fully requited the services which
she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.



Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,
with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends
to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not
fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.
She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,
and yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow
of her spirits, as her friend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.
Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it
in Captain Wentworth's affection.  His profession was all that could ever
make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war
all that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor's wife,
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession
which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues
than in its national importance.

      THIS little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended for immediate
      publication. It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even advertised,
      and why the business proceeded no farther, the author has never been able
      to learn. That any bookseller should think it worth-while to purchase what
      he did not think it worth-while to publish seems extraordinary. But with
      this, neither the author nor the public have any other concern than as
      some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen
      years have made comparatively obsolete. The public are entreated to bear
      in mind that thirteen years have passed since it was finished, many more
      since it was begun, and that during that period, places, manners, books,
      and opinions have undergone considerable changes.
    
    
       
    
    
    
        
       
    
    
      CHAPTER 1
    
    
      No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have
      supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character
      of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were all equally
      against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being neglected, or poor,
      and a very respectable man, though his name was Richard&mdash;and he had
      never been handsome. He had a considerable independence besides two good
      livings&mdash;and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his
      daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good
      temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had
      three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the
      latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on&mdash;lived
      to have six children more&mdash;to see them growing up around her, and to
      enjoy excellent health herself. A family of ten children will be always
      called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for
      the number; but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they
      were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many years of her life, as
      plain as any. She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour,
      dark lank hair, and strong features&mdash;so much for her person; and not
      less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind. She was fond of all boy&rsquo;s
      plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more
      heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird,
      or watering a rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she
      gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief&mdash;at
      least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was
      forbidden to take. Such were her propensities&mdash;her abilities were
      quite as extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything
      before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often
      inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in
      teaching her only to repeat the &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s Petition&rdquo;; and after all, her
      next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherine
      was always stupid&mdash;by no means; she learnt the fable of &ldquo;The Hare and
      Many Friends&rdquo; as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her to
      learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was very
      fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight years
      old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs. Morland,
      who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of
      incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which dismissed
      the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine&rsquo;s life. Her taste
      for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside
      of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper,
      she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and
      chickens, all very much like one another. Writing and accounts she was
      taught by her father; French by her mother: her proficiency in either was
      not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could.
      What a strange, unaccountable character!&mdash;for with all these symptoms
      of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad
      temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to
      the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy
      and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in
      the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.
    
    
      Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;
      she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved,
      her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more
      animation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to
      an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had
      now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her
      personal improvement. &ldquo;Catherine grows quite a good-looking girl&mdash;she
      is almost pretty today,&rdquo; were words which caught her ears now and then;
      and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an acquisition
      of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen
      years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.
    
    
      Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children
      everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in lying-in
      and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were inevitably
      left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful that
      Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer
      cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country at
      the age of fourteen, to books&mdash;or at least books of information&mdash;for,
      provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them,
      provided they were all story and no reflection, she had never any
      objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen she was in
      training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines must read to
      supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and
      so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.
    
    
      From Pope, she learnt to censure those who

      Chapter 1
    
    
      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
      a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
    
    
      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
      first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
      of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
      of some one or other of their daughters.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said his lady to him one day, &ldquo;have you heard that
      Netherfield Park is let at last?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    
    
      &ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
      me all about it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.
    
    
      &ldquo;Do you not want to know who has taken it?&rdquo; cried his wife impatiently.
    
    
      &ldquo;You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was invitation enough.
    
    
      &ldquo;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
      a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
      on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
      with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
      possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
      house by the end of next week.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Bingley.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is he married or single?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
      five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How so? How can it affect them?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; replied his wife, &ldquo;how can you be so tiresome! You
      must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is that his design in settling here?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may
      fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as
      he comes.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
      them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
      handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty,
      but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
      five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
      beauty.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
      the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be
      for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
      on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
      you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you
      do not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
      to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
      consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
      throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
      others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
      good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the
      preference.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;they are all
      silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
      quickness than her sisters.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
      take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
      my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
      last twenty years at least.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
      thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
      visit them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
      all.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
      and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
      insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind
      was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
      little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
      fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters
      married; its solace was visiting and news.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 2
    
    
      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
      had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
      wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid
      she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.
      Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly
      addressed her with:
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,&rdquo; said her
      mother resentfully, &ldquo;since we are not to visit.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you forget, mamma,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;that we shall meet him at the
      assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
      her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
      her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet; &ldquo;and I am glad to find that you do not
      depend on her serving you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself,
      began scolding one of her daughters.
    
    
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Have a little
      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;she times them
      ill.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not cough for my own amusement,&rdquo; replied Kitty fretfully. &ldquo;When is
      your next ball to be, Lizzy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To-morrow fortnight.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Aye, so it is,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;and Mrs. Long does not come back till
      the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she
      will not know him herself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
      Mr. Bingley to her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
      myself; how can you be so teasing?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&rsquo;s acquaintance is certainly
      very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
      fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after
      all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
      as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
      take it on myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &ldquo;Nonsense,
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Do you
      consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,
      as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you,
      Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great
      books and make extracts.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
    
    
      &ldquo;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;let us return to Mr.
      Bingley.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; cried his wife.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before?
      If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
      him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
      escape the acquaintance now.&rdquo;
     
    
      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
      Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
      was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
      while.
    
    
      &ldquo;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade
      you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an
      acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too,
      that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till
      now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet; and,
      as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
    
    
      &ldquo;What an excellent father you have, girls!&rdquo; said she, when the door was
      shut. &ldquo;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
      or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant,
      I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your
      sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the
      youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lydia stoutly, &ldquo;I am not afraid; for though I am the
      youngest, I&rsquo;m the tallest.&rdquo;
     
    
      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 3
    
    
      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
      daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
      husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in
      various ways&mdash;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
      distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
      last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
      Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
      delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
      with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
      dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes
      of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s heart were entertained.
    
    
      &ldquo;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, &ldquo;and all the others equally well married,
      I shall have nothing to wish for.&rdquo;
     
    
      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and sat about ten
      minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
      admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
      much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,
      for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he
      wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
    
    
      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
      Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
      housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
      was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to
      accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
      disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so
      soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he
      might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by
      starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party
      for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring
      twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls
      grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before
      the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him
      from London&mdash;his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party
      entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether&mdash;Mr.
      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young
      man.
    
    
      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
      with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
      looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of
      the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the
      report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his
      entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him
      to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer
      than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about
      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of
      his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his
      company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in
      Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable
      countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
    
    
      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people
      in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry
      that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at
      Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a
      contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
      Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,
      speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.
      He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody
      hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent
      against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was
      sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her
      daughters.
    
    
      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
      down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
      standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
      Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to
      join it.
    
    
      &ldquo;Come, Darcy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing
      about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly
      acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be
      insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in
      the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bingley, &ldquo;for a
      kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
      life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
      uncommonly pretty.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of
      her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare
      say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Which do you mean?&rdquo; and turning round he looked for a moment at
      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
      &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no
      humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by
      other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for
      you are wasting your time with me.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
      remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
      however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
      playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
    
    
      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
      Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
      Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by
      his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,
      though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&rsquo;s pleasure. Mary had heard
      herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the
      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to
      be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at
      a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the
      village where they lived, and of which they were the principal
      inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless
      of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to
      the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He
      had rather hoped that his wife&rsquo;s views on the stranger would be
      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; as she entered the room, &ldquo;we have had a most
      delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane
      was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she
      looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her
      twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her
      twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
      time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
      up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
      can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down
      the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her
      for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two
      fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two
      sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger&mdash;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If he had had any compassion for me,&rdquo; cried her husband
      impatiently, &ldquo;he would not have danced half so much! For God&rsquo;s sake, say
      no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first
      dance!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
      anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
      Hurst&rsquo;s gown&mdash;&rdquo;
     
    
      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of
      the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
      exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
    
    
      &ldquo;But I can assure you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Lizzy does not lose much by not
      suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not
      at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
      him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
      Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
      have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 4
    
    
      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
      her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
      much she admired him.
    
    
      &ldquo;He is just what a young man ought to be,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sensible,
      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!&mdash;so much
      ease, with such perfect good breeding!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He is also handsome,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;which a young man ought
      likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did
      not expect such a compliment.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us.
      Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What
      could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing
      that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.
      No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable,
      and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear Lizzy!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
      You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in
      your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what
      I think.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your
      good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
      Affectation of candour is common enough&mdash;one meets with it
      everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design&mdash;to take
      the good of everybody&rsquo;s character and make it still better, and say
      nothing of the bad&mdash;belongs to you alone. And so you like this man&rsquo;s
      sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
      converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his
      house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
      neighbour in her.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
      the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
      quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
      with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
      little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not
      deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
      making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.
      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
      seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
      habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of
      rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
      themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the
      north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories
      than that their brother&rsquo;s fortune and their own had been acquired by
      trade.
    
    
      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand
      pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did
      not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made
      choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the
      liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the
      easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his
      days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.
    
    
      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though
      he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means
      unwilling to preside at his table&mdash;nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
      married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his
      house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two
      years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at
      Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour&mdash;was
      pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what
      the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
    
    
      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
      great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
      easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
      could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
      never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy&rsquo;s regard, Bingley
      had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In
      understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,
      but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that
      respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being
      liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.
    
    
      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
      characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
      prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to
      him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
      acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
      conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
      collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
      none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
      either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
      but she smiled too much.
    
    
      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so&mdash;but still they admired
      her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
      they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
      established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
      commendation to think of her as he chose.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 5
    
    
      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
      particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
      Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of
      knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction
      had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his
      business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting
      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from
      Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think
      with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy
      himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his
      rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all
      attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his
      presentation at St. James&rsquo;s had made him courteous.
    
    
      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable
      neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a
      sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      intimate friend.
    
    
      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball
      was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the
      former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
    
    
      &ldquo;You began the evening well, Charlotte,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet with
      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. &ldquo;You were Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s first
      choice.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
      sure that did seem as if he admired her&mdash;indeed I rather
      believe he did&mdash;I heard something about it&mdash;but I hardly
      know what&mdash;something about Mr. Robinson.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I
      mention it to you? Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s asking him how he liked our Meryton
      assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
      women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his
      answering immediately to the last question: &lsquo;Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
      beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed&mdash;that does seem as
      if&mdash;but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours,
      Eliza,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as
      his friend, is he?&mdash;poor Eliza!&mdash;to be only just tolerable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I beg you would not put it into Lizzy&rsquo;s head to be vexed by his
      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a
      misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat
      close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;is not there a little mistake?&rdquo; said
      Jane. &ldquo;I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
      could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being
      spoke to.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bingley told me,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;that he never speaks much, unless
      among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably
      agreeable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable,
      he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody
      says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow
      that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a
      hack chaise.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas, &ldquo;but I wish
      he had danced with Eliza.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Another time, Lizzy,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;I would not dance with him,
      if I were you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe, ma&rsquo;am, I may safely promise you never to dance with
      him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;His pride,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas, &ldquo;does not offend me so much as pride
      often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
      very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
      should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right
      to be proud.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;and I could easily forgive his
      pride, if he had not mortified mine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pride,&rdquo; observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
      reflections, &ldquo;is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever
      read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is
      particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not
      cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or
      other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though
      the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being
      vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we
      would have others think of us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; cried a young Lucas, who came with his
      sisters, &ldquo;I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
      foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet;
      &ldquo;and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.&rdquo;
     
    
      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
      would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 6
    
    
      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was
      soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet&rsquo;s pleasing manners grew on the
      goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found
      to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish
      of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two
      eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure,
      but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,
      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their
      kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all
      probability from the influence of their brother&rsquo;s admiration. It was
      generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to
      her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
      which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way
      to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not
      likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with
      great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform
      cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the
      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
    
    
      &ldquo;It may perhaps be pleasant,&rdquo; replied Charlotte, &ldquo;to be able to impose on
      the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so
      very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from
      the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will
      then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
      There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that
      it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely&mdash;a
      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have
      heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out
      of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.
      Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like
      her, if she does not help him on.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
      perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
      discover it too.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane&rsquo;s disposition as you do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it,
      he must find it out.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
      meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
      always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every
      moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore
      make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.
      When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love
      as much as she chooses.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your plan is a good one,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;where nothing is in
      question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to
      get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
      these are not Jane&rsquo;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she
      cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
      reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances
      with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has
      since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to
      make her understand his character.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might
      only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember
      that four evenings have also been spent together&mdash;and four evenings
      may do a great deal.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
      like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading
      characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Charlotte, &ldquo;I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she
      were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of
      happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.
      Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions
      of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar
      beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always
      continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of
      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of
      the person with whom you are to pass your life.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
      sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.&rdquo;
     
    
      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
      was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
      interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
      allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
      ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
      sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had
      a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
      this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
      detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in
      her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
      pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of
      the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this
      she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself
      agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance
      with.
    
    
      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
      with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
      drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas&rsquo;s, where a large party were
      assembled.
    
    
      &ldquo;What does Mr. Darcy mean,&rdquo; said she to Charlotte, &ldquo;by listening to my
      conversation with Colonel Forster?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what
      he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being
      impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.&rdquo;
     
    
      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
      any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a
      subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned
      to him and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
      just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
      Meryton?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
      energetic.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are severe on us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It will be her turn soon to be teased,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas. &ldquo;I am
      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!&mdash;always wanting
      me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
      musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really
      rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the
      very best performers.&rdquo; On Miss Lucas&rsquo;s persevering, however, she added,
      &ldquo;Very well, if it must be so, it must.&rdquo; And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,
      &ldquo;There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar
      with: &lsquo;Keep your breath to cool your porridge&rsquo;; and I shall keep mine to
      swell my song.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or
      two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
      would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
      sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the
      family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
      impatient for display.
    
    
      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
      application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
      manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
      had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
      much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end
      of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch
      and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of
      the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one
      end of the room.
    
    
      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing
      the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much
      engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his
      neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
    
    
      &ldquo;What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is
      nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
      refinements of polished society.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
      the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.&rdquo;
     
    
      Sir William only smiled. &ldquo;Your friend performs delightfully,&rdquo; he continued
      after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; &ldquo;and I doubt not that you
      are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
      you often dance at St. James&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Never, sir.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have a house in town, I conclude?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy bowed.
    
    
      &ldquo;I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself&mdash;for I am fond
      of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
      London would agree with Lady Lucas.&rdquo;
     
    
      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
      make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck
      with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me
      to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot
      refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.&rdquo; And, taking
      her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely
      surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,
      and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
    
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not
      to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her
      hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
      shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
    
    
      &ldquo;You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
      the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
      amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
      for one half-hour.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is all politeness,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, smiling.
    
    
      &ldquo;He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
      cannot wonder at his complaisance&mdash;for who would object to such a
      partner?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
      her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency,
      when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
    
    
      &ldquo;I can guess the subject of your reverie.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should imagine not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
      in this manner&mdash;in such society; and indeed I am quite of your
      opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise&mdash;the
      nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I
      give to hear your strictures on them!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which
      a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would
      tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy
      replied with great intrepidity:
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Bennet!&rdquo; repeated Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I am all astonishment.
      How long has she been such a favourite?&mdash;and pray, when am I to wish
      you joy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&rsquo;s
      imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to
      matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
      absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
      and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain
      herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was
      safe, her wit flowed long.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 7
    
    
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
      thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in
      default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother&rsquo;s fortune,
      though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the
      deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had
      left her four thousand pounds.
    
    
      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their
      father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London
      in a respectable line of trade.
    
    
      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient
      distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or
      four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner&rsquo;s
      shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and
      Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were
      more vacant than their sisters&rsquo;, and when nothing better offered, a walk
      to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in
      general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At
      present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by
      the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to
      remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.
    
    
      Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting
      intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
      officers&rsquo; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
      and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips
      visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity
      unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s
      large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.
    
    
      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet
      coolly observed:
    
    
      &ldquo;From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of
      the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am
      now convinced.&rdquo;
     
    
      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
      indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
      her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next
      morning to London.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am astonished, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;that you should be so ready
      to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of
      anybody&rsquo;s children, it should not be of my own, however.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had
      hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far
      differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
      foolish.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
      their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
      not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
      liked a red coat myself very well&mdash;and, indeed, so I do still at my
      heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
      should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
      Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&rsquo;s in
      his regimentals.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; cried Lydia, &ldquo;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
      Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&rsquo;s as they did when they first
      came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&rsquo;s library.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
      note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for
      an answer. Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly
      calling out, while her daughter read,
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
      Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is from Miss Bingley,&rdquo; said Jane, and then read it aloud.
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we
      shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a
      whole day&rsquo;s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel.
      Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen
      are to dine with the officers.&mdash;Yours ever,
    
    
      &ldquo;CAROLINE BINGLEY&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With the officers!&rdquo; cried Lydia. &ldquo;I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dining out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;that is very unlucky.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Can I have the carriage?&rdquo; said Jane.
    
    
      &ldquo;No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
      rain; and then you must stay all night.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That would be a good scheme,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;if you were sure that they
      would not offer to send her home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s chaise to go to Meryton,
      and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had much rather go in the coach.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
      wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if you have got them to-day,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;my mother&rsquo;s purpose
      will be answered.&rdquo;
     
    
      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
      were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
      mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
      day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained
      hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The
      rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly
      could not come back.
    
    
      &ldquo;This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet more than once,
      as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
      morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
      contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
      brought the following note for Elizabeth:
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST LIZZY,&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear
      of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones&mdash;therefore
      do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me&mdash;and,
      excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with
      me.&mdash;Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,
      &ldquo;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness&mdash;if she
      should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
      Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
      colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
      all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the
      carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her
      only alternative. She declared her resolution.
    
    
      &ldquo;How can you be so silly,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;as to think of such a thing,
      in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall be very fit to see Jane&mdash;which is all I want.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;to send for the horses?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when
      one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I admire the activity of your benevolence,&rdquo; observed Mary, &ldquo;but every
      impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
      exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We will go as far as Meryton with you,&rdquo; said Catherine and Lydia.
      Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
      together.
    
    
      &ldquo;If we make haste,&rdquo; said Lydia, as they walked along, &ldquo;perhaps we may see
      something of Captain Carter before he goes.&rdquo;
     
    
      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
      of the officers&rsquo; wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
      field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over
      puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view
      of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with
      the warmth of exercise.
    
    
      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That
      she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty
      weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for
      it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
      brother&rsquo;s manners there was something better than politeness; there was
      good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
      nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
      brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the
      occasion&rsquo;s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking
      only of his breakfast.
    
    
      Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
      Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
      enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
      immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
      alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for
      such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however,
      to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could
      attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary
      kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.
    
    
      When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
      began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude
      they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his
      patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold,
      and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to
      return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed
      readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.
      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies
      often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do
      elsewhere.
    
    
      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
      unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
      wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in
      parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of
      the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
      Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
      Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of
      clothes.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 8
    
    
      At five o&rsquo;clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
      Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured
      in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much
      superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s, she could not make a very favourable
      answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this,
      repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it
      was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill
      themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference
      towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the
      enjoyment of all her former dislike.
    
    
      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard
      with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions
      to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much
      an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very
      little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy,
      her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat,
      he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards;
      who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to
      say to her.
    
    
      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
      began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
      pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she
      had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and
      added:
    
    
      &ldquo;She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
      walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
      looked almost wild.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
      nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the
      country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in
      mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide
      it not doing its office.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,&rdquo; said Bingley; &ldquo;but this was all
      lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when
      she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my
      notice.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley; &ldquo;and I
      am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister
      make such an exhibition.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
      above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
      it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a
      most country-town indifference to decorum.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,&rdquo; said
      Bingley.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, &ldquo;that
      this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;they were brightened by the exercise.&rdquo; A short
      pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
    
    
      &ldquo;I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
      sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
      such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
      no chance of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is capital,&rdquo; added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
    
    
      &ldquo;If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,&rdquo; cried Bingley,
      &ldquo;it would not make them one jot less agreeable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
      consideration in the world,&rdquo; replied Darcy.
    
    
      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
      hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
      their dear friend&rsquo;s vulgar relations.
    
    
      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
      leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She
      was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late
      in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it
      seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs
      herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo,
      and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be
      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she
      would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.
      Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
    
    
      &ldquo;Do you prefer reading to cards?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is rather singular.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Eliza Bennet,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, &ldquo;despises cards. She is a great
      reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;I am
      not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,&rdquo; said Bingley; &ldquo;and I
      hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table
      where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others&mdash;all
      that his library afforded.
    
    
      &ldquo;And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit;
      but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I
      ever looked into.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in
      the room.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am astonished,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, &ldquo;that my father should have left so
      small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
      Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It ought to be good,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it has been the work of many
      generations.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
      books.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
      these.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
      that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may
      be half as delightful as Pemberley.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish it may.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
      finer county in England than Derbyshire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am talking of possibilities, Charles.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley
      by purchase than by imitation.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little
      attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the
      card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
      sister, to observe the game.
    
    
      &ldquo;Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?&rdquo; said Miss Bingley; &ldquo;will she
      be as tall as I am?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet&rsquo;s height, or
      rather taller.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so
      much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for
      her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is amazing to me,&rdquo; said Bingley, &ldquo;how young ladies can have patience
      to be so very accomplished as they all are.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net
      purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
      never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
      informed that she was very accomplished.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;has too
      much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
      otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far
      from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot
      boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
      acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nor I, I am sure,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley.
    
    
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; observed Elizabeth, &ldquo;you must comprehend a great deal in your idea
      of an accomplished woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; cried his faithful assistant, &ldquo;no one can be really
      esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
      with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
      dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
      this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
      walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
      will be but half-deserved.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;All this she must possess,&rdquo; added Darcy, &ldquo;and to all this she must yet
      add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
      extensive reading.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished
      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
      this?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
      application, and elegance, as you describe united.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
      implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
      answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
      bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
      conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
      room.
    
    
      &ldquo;Elizabeth Bennet,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
      &ldquo;is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
      other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
      succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
      &ldquo;there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes
      condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning
      is despicable.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue
      the subject.
    
    
      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
      that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
      immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be
      of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent
      physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to
      comply with their brother&rsquo;s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones
      should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly
      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they
      were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after
      supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by
      giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to
      the sick lady and her sister.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 9
    
    
      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister&rsquo;s room, and in the
      morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
      inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
      and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
      sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note
      sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own
      judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its
      contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two
      youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
    
    
      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
      very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not
      alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
      restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
      would not listen, therefore, to her daughter&rsquo;s proposal of being carried
      home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
      it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
      Bingley&rsquo;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
      attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that
      Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
    
    
      &ldquo;Indeed I have, sir,&rdquo; was her answer. &ldquo;She is a great deal too ill to be
      moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a
      little longer on your kindness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Removed!&rdquo; cried Bingley. &ldquo;It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
      sure, will not hear of her removal.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it, Madam,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
      &ldquo;that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains
      with us.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if it was not for such good friends I do not know
      what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast
      deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the
      way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have
      ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.
      You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the
      gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though
      you have but a short lease.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Whatever I do is done in a hurry,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;and therefore if I should
      resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At
      present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;You begin to comprehend me, do you?&rdquo; cried he, turning towards her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;I understand you perfectly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
      through I am afraid is pitiful.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;remember where you are, and do not run on in
      the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I did not know before,&rdquo; continued Bingley immediately, &ldquo;that you were a
      studier of character. It must be an amusing study.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at
      least that advantage.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The country,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;can in general supply but a few subjects for
      such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
      unvarying society.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
      observed in them for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
      country neighbourhood. &ldquo;I assure you there is quite as much of that
      going on in the country as in town.&rdquo;
     
    
      Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
      turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
      victory over him, continued her triumph.
    
    
      &ldquo;I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my
      part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
      pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;When I am in the country,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I never wish to leave it; and
      when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
      advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;that is because you have the right disposition. But that
      gentleman,&rdquo; looking at Darcy, &ldquo;seemed to think the country was nothing at
      all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, blushing for her
      mother. &ldquo;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
      such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
      which you must acknowledge to be true.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
      many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods
      larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.&rdquo;
     
    
      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
      countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
      Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying
      something that might turn her mother&rsquo;s thoughts, now asked her if
      Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
      William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel
      and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my
      idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
      important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Did Charlotte dine with you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
      my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
      my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
      judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
      assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte
      so very plain&mdash;but then she is our particular friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She seems a very pleasant young woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has
      often said so, and envied me Jane&rsquo;s beauty. I do not like to boast of my
      own child, but to be sure, Jane&mdash;one does not often see anybody
      better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
      partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
      Gardiner&rsquo;s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure
      he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not.
      Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her,
      and very pretty they were.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And so ended his affection,&rdquo; said Elizabeth impatiently. &ldquo;There has been
      many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
      discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,&rdquo; said
      Darcy.
    
    
      &ldquo;Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
      strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am
      convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
      tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
      speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
      Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane,
      with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
      unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
      civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
      indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon
      afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her
      daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each
      other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest
      should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the
      country to give a ball at Netherfield.
    
    
      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and
      good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection
      had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits,
      and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the
      officers, to whom her uncle&rsquo;s good dinners, and her own easy manners
      recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal,
      therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly
      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful
      thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack
      was delightful to their mother&rsquo;s ear:
    
    
      &ldquo;I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your
      sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the
      ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lydia declared herself satisfied. &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;it would be much better
      to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
      would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
      Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
      instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations&rsquo; behaviour to the
      remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
      could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite
      of all Miss Bingley&rsquo;s witticisms on fine eyes.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 10
    
    
      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
      continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
      their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
      Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the
      progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
      messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
      Hurst was observing their game.
    
    
      Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
      attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
      commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
      of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
      with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
      exactly in union with her opinion of each.
    
    
      &ldquo;How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!&rdquo;
     
    
      He made no answer.
    
    
      &ldquo;You write uncommonly fast.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
      Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have already told her so once, by your desire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens
      remarkably well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;but I always mend my own.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How can you contrive to write so even?&rdquo;
     
    
      He was silent.
    
    
      &ldquo;Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
      and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
      little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
      Grantley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
      present I have not room to do them justice.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
      always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to
      determine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
      ease, cannot write ill.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,&rdquo; cried her brother,
      &ldquo;because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words
      of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My style of writing is very different from yours.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley, &ldquo;Charles writes in the most careless way
      imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them&mdash;by
      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
      correspondents.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your humility, Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;must disarm reproof.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nothing is more deceitful,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;than the appearance of humility.
      It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect
      boast.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of
      modesty?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing,
      because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and
      carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least
      highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always
      prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the
      imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning
      that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in
      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to
      yourself&mdash;and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance
      which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real
      advantage to yourself or anyone else?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Bingley, &ldquo;this is too much, to remember at night all the
      foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
      believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.
      At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
      precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would
      be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on
      chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse,
      a friend were to say, &lsquo;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&rsquo; you
      would probably do it, you would probably not go&mdash;and at another word,
      might stay a month.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have only proved by this,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;that Mr. Bingley did not
      do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more
      than he did himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly gratified,&rdquo; said Bingley, &ldquo;by your converting what my
      friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
      afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
      intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
      circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
      could.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as
      atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
      himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but
      which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
      according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the
      friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of
      his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in
      favour of its propriety.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To yield readily&mdash;easily&mdash;to the persuasion of a friend
      is no merit with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
      either.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
      friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one
      readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one
      into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
      supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
      circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
      thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
      where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
      very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with
      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
      with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain
      to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the
      parties?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; cried Bingley; &ldquo;let us hear all the particulars, not
      forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
      weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
      you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
      myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
      know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
      particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
      when he has nothing to do.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
      rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
      resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
      brother for talking such nonsense.
    
    
      &ldquo;I see your design, Bingley,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;You dislike an argument,
      and want to silence this.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
      Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
      thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What you ask,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy
      had much better finish his letter.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
    
    
      When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for
      an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the
      pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way
      which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated
      herself.
    
    
      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
      Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
      that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on
      her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
      admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
      he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
      at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong
      and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other
      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little
      to care for his approbation.
    
    
      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
      lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth,
      said to her:
    
    
      &ldquo;Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
      opportunity of dancing a reel?&rdquo;
     
    
      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
      surprise at her silence.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine
      what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; that you might
      have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in
      overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their
      premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you,
      that I do not want to dance a reel at all&mdash;and now despise me if you
      dare.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed I do not dare.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
      gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner
      which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never
      been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that
      were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some
      danger.
    
    
      Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety
      for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her
      desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
    
    
      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
      their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
      next day, &ldquo;you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
      desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
      and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
      officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check
      that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your
      lady possesses.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
      in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
      They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for
      your Elizabeth&rsquo;s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter
      could do justice to those beautiful eyes?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour
      and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.&rdquo;
     
    
      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth
      herself.
    
    
      &ldquo;I did not know that you intended to walk,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, in some
      confusion, lest they had been overheard.
    
    
      &ldquo;You used us abominably ill,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Hurst, &ldquo;running away without
      telling us that you were coming out.&rdquo;
     
    
      Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by
      herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and
      immediately said:
    
    
      &ldquo;This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
      avenue.&rdquo;
     
    
      But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
      laughingly answered:
    
    
      &ldquo;No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
      uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     
    
      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
      being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as
      to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 11
    
    
      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
      seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
      where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
      pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
      during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers
      of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment
      with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
      acquaintance with spirit.
    
    
      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss
      Bingley&rsquo;s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something
      to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to
      Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a
      slight bow, and said he was &ldquo;very glad;&rdquo; but diffuseness and warmth
      remained for Bingley&rsquo;s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The
      first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer
      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side
      of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat
      down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the
      opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
    
    
      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table&mdash;but
      in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish
      for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She
      assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole
      party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore
      nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now
      and then in her brother&rsquo;s conversation with Miss Bennet.
    
    
      Miss Bingley&rsquo;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was
      perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could
      not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
      question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
      amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
      second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &ldquo;How pleasant it is
      to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment
      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I
      have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent
      library.&rdquo;
     
    
      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
      cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her
      brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him
      and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
      Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
      the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some
      among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you mean Darcy,&rdquo; cried her brother, &ldquo;he may go to bed, if he chooses,
      before it begins&mdash;but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing;
      and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my
      cards.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should like balls infinitely better,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if they were
      carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
      tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
      more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
      the day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
      near so much like a ball.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
      about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
      whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation
      of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to
      Elizabeth, said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
      turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
      long in one attitude.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
      succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.
      He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
      Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
      directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
      he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
      the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
      interfere. &ldquo;What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
      meaning?&rdquo;&mdash;and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
      him?
    
    
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; was her answer; &ldquo;but depend upon it, he means to be severe
      on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
      about it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
      anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
      motives.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&rdquo; said he, as soon
      as she allowed him to speak. &ldquo;You either choose this method of passing the
      evening because you are in each other&rsquo;s confidence, and have secret
      affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear
      to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely
      in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by
      the fire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! shocking!&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I never heard anything so abominable.
      How shall we punish him for such a speech?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;We
      can all plague and punish one another. Tease him&mdash;laugh at him.
      Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has
      not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
      mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not
      expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
      Mr. Darcy may hug himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;That is an uncommon
      advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great
      loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bingley,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has given me more credit than can be. The wisest
      and the best of men&mdash;nay, the wisest and best of their actions&mdash;may
      be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth&mdash;&ldquo;there are such people, but I hope I
      am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
      Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I
      own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are
      precisely what you are without.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my
      life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding
      to ridicule.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Such as vanity and pride.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride&mdash;where there is a real
      superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
    
    
      &ldquo;Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley;
      &ldquo;and pray what is the result?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
      himself without disguise.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
      but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
      for. It is, I believe, too little yielding&mdash;certainly too little for
      the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
      others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
      are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would
      perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is a failing indeed!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;Implacable resentment
      is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
      really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
      evil&mdash;a natural defect, which not even the best education can
      overcome.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And your defect is to hate everybody.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And yours,&rdquo; he replied with a smile, &ldquo;is willfully to misunderstand
      them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do let us have a little music,&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
      conversation in which she had no share. &ldquo;Louisa, you will not mind my
      waking Mr. Hurst?&rdquo;
     
    
      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened;
      and Darcy, after a few moments&rsquo; recollection, was not sorry for it. He
      began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 12
    
    
      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
      next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
      them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her
      daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would
      exactly finish Jane&rsquo;s week, could not bring herself to receive them with
      pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not
      to Elizabeth&rsquo;s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent
      them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday;
      and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister
      pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against
      staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved&mdash;nor did
      she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being
      considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to
      borrow Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled
      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be
      mentioned, and the request made.
    
    
      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said
      of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane;
      and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry
      that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one
      sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
    
    
      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
      soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
      safe for her&mdash;that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm
      where she felt herself to be right.
    
    
      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence&mdash;Elizabeth had been at
      Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked&mdash;and
      Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to
      himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of
      admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her
      with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea
      had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material
      weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely
      spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
      at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
      conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
    
    
      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
      all, took place. Miss Bingley&rsquo;s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
      very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
      after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see
      her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly,
      she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole
      party in the liveliest of spirits.
    
    
      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
      wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
      trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father,
      though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see
      them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening
      conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
      animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.
    
    
      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
      nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
      threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for
      them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the
      regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined
      lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually
      been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 13
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast
      the next morning, &ldquo;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I
      have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
      unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in&mdash;and I hope my
      dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at
      home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
      Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
      Bingley. But&mdash;good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to
      be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell&mdash;I must speak to Hill
      this moment.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is not Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;it is a person whom I
      never saw in the whole course of my life.&rdquo;
     
    
      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
      eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
    
    
      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
    
    
      &ldquo;About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I
      answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early
      attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may
      turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear,&rdquo; cried his wife, &ldquo;I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray
      do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the
      world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children;
      and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do
      something or other about it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
      had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
      Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly
      against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five
      daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
    
    
      &ldquo;It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;and nothing
      can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you
      will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his
      manner of expressing himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him
      to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends.
      Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before
      him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head,
      as you will hear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
    
    
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father
      always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to
      lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I
      was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful
      to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had
      always pleased him to be at variance.&mdash;&lsquo;There, Mrs. Bennet.&rsquo;&mdash;My
      mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received
      ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by
      the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of
      Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
      valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
      demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever
      ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the
      Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote
      and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my
      influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures
      are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
      entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not
      lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than
      concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg
      leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to
      make them every possible amends&mdash;but of this hereafter. If you should
      have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the
      satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by
      four o&rsquo;clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the
      Saturday se&rsquo;ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience,
      as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of
      the day.&mdash;I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your
      lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
    
    
      &ldquo;WILLIAM COLLINS&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. &ldquo;He seems to be a most
      conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
      prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
      indulgent as to let him come to us again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he
      is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
      discourage him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Though it is difficult,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;to guess in what way he can mean to
      make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
      credit.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
      Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
      his parishioners whenever it were required.
    
    
      &ldquo;He must be an oddity, I think,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I cannot make him out.&mdash;There
      is something very pompous in his style.&mdash;And what can he mean by
      apologising for being next in the entail?&mdash;We cannot suppose he would
      help it if he could.&mdash;Could he be a sensible man, sir?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
      reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
      letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In point of composition,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;the letter does not seem defective.
      The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is
      well expressed.&rdquo;
     
    
      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
      degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
      come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received
      pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their
      mother, Mr. Collins&rsquo;s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she
      was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her
      husband and daughters.
    
    
      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
      ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
      of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
      heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately,
      and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he
      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he
      had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen
      short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all
      in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the
      taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no
      compliments, answered most readily.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove
      so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must
      confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I
      know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go
      when once they come to be entailed.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could
      say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and
      precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to
      admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are
      better acquainted&mdash;&rdquo;
     
    
      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
      other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s admiration. The
      hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
      and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s heart,
      but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future
      property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to
      know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing.
      But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some
      asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her
      daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having
      displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all
      offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 14
    
    
      During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
      were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
      guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine,
      by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
      Catherine de Bourgh&rsquo;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
      comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
      better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
      to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
      he protested that &ldquo;he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
      person of rank&mdash;such affability and condescension, as he had himself
      experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
      approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
      preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and
      had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
      quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people
      he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She
      had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not
      the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood
      nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his
      relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he
      could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in
      his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations
      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself&mdash;some
      shelves in the closet up stairs.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;and I
      dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in
      general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
      from Rosings Park, her ladyship&rsquo;s residence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive
      property.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, &ldquo;then she is better off than
      many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
      that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
      handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
      the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
      constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
      accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
      informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
      resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to
      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
      court.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and
      by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British
      court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the
      idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those
      little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have
      more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter
      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of
      giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of
      little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention
      which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You judge very properly,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;and it is happy for you that
      you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether
      these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are
      the result of previous study?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
      sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
      compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give
      them as unstudied an air as possible.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as
      he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
      maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
      and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
      his pleasure.
    
    
      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
      take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad
      to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,
      and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it
      to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,
      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
      exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose
      Fordyce&rsquo;s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had,
      with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him
      with:
    
    
      &ldquo;Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard;
      and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself
      on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and
      to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
      Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of
      a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I
      confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as
      instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.&rdquo;
     
    
      Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
      backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
      very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
      Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia&rsquo;s interruption,
      and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book;
      but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no
      ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated
      himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 15
    
    
      Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been
      but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life
      having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father;
      and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the
      necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The
      subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally
      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the
      self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential
      feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had
      recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford
      was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his
      veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of
      himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made
      him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and
      humility.
    
    
      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
      marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a
      wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them
      as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This
      was his plan of amends&mdash;of atonement&mdash;for inheriting their
      father&rsquo;s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility
      and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
      part.
    
    
      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet&rsquo;s lovely face confirmed
      his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to
      seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.
      The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an
      hour&rsquo;s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation
      beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of
      his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced
      from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a
      caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. &ldquo;As to her younger
      daughters, she could not take upon her to say&mdash;she could not
      positively answer&mdash;but she did not know of any prepossession;
      her eldest daughter, she must just mention&mdash;she felt it
      incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth&mdash;and it was
      soon done&mdash;done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth,
      equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
      two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the
      day before was now high in her good graces.
    
    
      Lydia&rsquo;s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
      except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at
      the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and
      have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him
      after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one
      of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet,
      with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings
      discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure
      of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to
      meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used
      to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in
      inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins,
      being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely
      pleased to close his large book, and go.
    
    
      In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins,
      their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger
      ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately
      wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than
      a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could
      recall them.
    
    
      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they
      had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with
      another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.
      Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he
      bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger&rsquo;s air, all
      wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to
      find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting
      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
      pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.
      Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce
      his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from
      town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.
      This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only
      regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in
      his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good
      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his
      side by a happy readiness of conversation&mdash;a readiness at the same
      time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still
      standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses
      drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
      On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly
      towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal
      spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on
      his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy
      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his
      eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
      stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
      looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
      Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a
      few moments, touched his hat&mdash;a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
      imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
    
    
      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
      passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
    
    
      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.
      Phillip&rsquo;s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia&rsquo;s
      pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
      invitation.
    
    
      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
      their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
      expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
      carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she
      had not happened to see Mr. Jones&rsquo;s shop-boy in the street, who had told
      her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because
      the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.
      Collins by Jane&rsquo;s introduction of him. She received him with her very best
      politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his
      intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not
      help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship
      to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was
      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of
      one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about
      the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they
      already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was
      to have a lieutenant&rsquo;s commission in the &mdash;&mdash;shire. She had been
      watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,
      and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have
      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a
      few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become
      &ldquo;stupid, disagreeable fellows.&rdquo; Some of them were to dine with the
      Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call
      on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from
      Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
      protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
      delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
      Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with
      unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
    
    
      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
      between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
      both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such
      behaviour than her sister.
    
    
      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
      Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
      she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly
      included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly
      unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his
      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in
      the whole course of his life.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 16
    
    
      As no objection was made to the young people&rsquo;s engagement with their aunt,
      and all Mr. Collins&rsquo;s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single
      evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed
      him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had
      the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.
      Wickham had accepted their uncle&rsquo;s invitation, and was then in the house.
    
    
      When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
      Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
      struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
      might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
      at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification;
      but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was
      its proprietor&mdash;when she had listened to the description of only one
      of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone
      had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment,
      and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.
    
    
      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
      with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
      improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen
      joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener,
      whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who
      was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.
      To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to
      do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent
      imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared
      very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and
      when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither
      been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest
      degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the &mdash;&mdash;shire
      were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them
      were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in
      person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the
      broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them
      into the room.
    
    
      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
      turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
      himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
      conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
      that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
      interesting by the skill of the speaker.
    
    
      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
      officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
      ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
      listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
      supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had
      the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
    
    
      &ldquo;I know little of the game at present,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I shall be glad to
      improve myself, for in my situation in life&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Phillips was very
      glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
    
    
      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received
      at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed
      danger of Lydia&rsquo;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined
      talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon
      grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and
      exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
      Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at
      leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though
      what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told&mdash;the
      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention
      that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr.
      Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was
      from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating
      manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
    
    
      &ldquo;About a month,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
      drop, added, &ldquo;He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
      understand.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wickham; &ldquo;his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
      thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
      giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been
      connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
    
    
      &ldquo;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
      seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
      yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;As much as I ever wish to be,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth very warmly. &ldquo;I have spent
      four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have no right to give my opinion,&rdquo; said Wickham, &ldquo;as to his
      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known
      him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me
      to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
      astonish&mdash;and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
      anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in
      the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
      Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
      him more favourably spoken of by anyone.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&rdquo; said Wickham, after a short interruption,
      &ldquo;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but
      with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded
      by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing
      manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an
      ill-tempered man.&rdquo; Wickham only shook his head.
    
    
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, &ldquo;whether he is
      likely to be in this country much longer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I
      was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the &mdash;&mdash;shire
      will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If
      he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on
      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no
      reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the
      world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his
      being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of
      the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I
      can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the
      soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
      everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
      memory of his father.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
      all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
    
    
      Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had
      yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible
      gallantry.
    
    
      &ldquo;It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;which was my chief inducement to enter the &mdash;&mdash;shire. I knew it
      to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
      further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
      attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society,
      I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits
      will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A
      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now
      made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession&mdash;I
      was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
      possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were
      speaking of just now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the
      best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to
      me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
      and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
      elsewhere.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;but how could that be? How could
      his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give
      me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention,
      but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it&mdash;or to treat it as a merely
      conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
      to it by extravagance, imprudence&mdash;in short anything or nothing.
      Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
      was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
      less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may
      have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can
      recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of
      men, and that he hates me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Some time or other he will be&mdash;but it shall not be by me.
      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
      ever as he expressed them.
    
    
      &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;can have been his motive? What can
      have induced him to behave so cruelly?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A thorough, determined dislike of me&mdash;a dislike which I cannot but
      attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
      less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father&rsquo;s uncommon
      attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not
      a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood&mdash;the sort
      of preference which was often given me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this&mdash;though I have never
      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
      despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
      descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
      this.&rdquo;
     
    
      After a few minutes&rsquo; reflection, however, she continued, &ldquo;I do
      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
      resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be
      dreadful.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I will not trust myself on the subject,&rdquo; replied Wickham; &ldquo;I can hardly
      be just to him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, &ldquo;To treat
      in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!&rdquo; She
      could have added, &ldquo;A young man, too, like you, whose very
      countenance may vouch for your being amiable&rdquo;&mdash;but she contented
      herself with, &ldquo;and one, too, who had probably been his companion from
      childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
      manner!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part
      of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the
      same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began
      life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so
      much credit to&mdash;but he gave up everything to be of use to the late
      Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.
      He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest
      obligations to my father&rsquo;s active superintendence, and when, immediately
      before my father&rsquo;s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of
      providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of
      gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;How abominable! I wonder that the very
      pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
      motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest&mdash;for
      dishonesty I must call it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; replied Wickham, &ldquo;for almost all his actions may
      be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
      connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
      none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
      impulses even than pride.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
      freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
      poor. Family pride, and filial pride&mdash;for he is very proud of
      what his father was&mdash;have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his
      family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of
      the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly
      pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind
      and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried
      up as the most attentive and best of brothers.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
      speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother&mdash;very,
      very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely
      fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she
      is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
      and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father&rsquo;s death, her home
      has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
      education.&rdquo;
     
    
      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
      help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
    
    
      &ldquo;I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
      who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be
      in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know
      Mr. Bingley?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
      Darcy is.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want
      abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his
      while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very
      different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never
      deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere,
      rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable&mdash;allowing something for
      fortune and figure.&rdquo;
     
    
      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
      the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
      Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
      made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
      but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
      her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
      that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would
      not make herself uneasy.
    
    
      &ldquo;I know very well, madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that when persons sit down to a
      card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am
      not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are
      undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine
      de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little
      matters.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a
      few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was
      very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
    
    
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine de Bourgh,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;has very lately given him a
      living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice,
      but he certainly has not known her long.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were
      sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
      believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.&rdquo;
     
    
      This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
      Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
      affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
      self-destined for another.
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Collins,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
      daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I
      suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
      patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe her to be both in a great degree,&rdquo; replied Wickham; &ldquo;I have not
      seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her,
      and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation
      of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives
      part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her
      authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who
      chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
      the first class.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
      they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put
      an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
      Wickham&rsquo;s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.
      Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
      Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing
      but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but
      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for
      neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly
      of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and
      Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
      protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist,
      enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he
      crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the
      carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 17
    
    
      Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham
      and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how
      to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s regard;
      and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man
      of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having
      endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;
      and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both,
      to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or
      mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.
    
    
      &ldquo;They have both,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
      other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
      misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
      conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
      without actual blame on either side.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
      behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
      business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
      somebody.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
      My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places
      Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&rsquo;s favourite in such a manner, one
      whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of
      common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be
      capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in
      him? Oh! no.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s being imposed on, than that
      Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
      night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not
      so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is difficult indeed&mdash;it is distressing. One does not know what to
      think.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.&rdquo;
     
    
      But Jane could think with certainty on only one point&mdash;that Mr.
      Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when
      the affair became public.
    
    
      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
      been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
      invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for
      the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear
      friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked
      what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest
      of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as
      possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.
      They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which
      took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape
      from Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s civilities.
    
    
      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
      female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
      compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
      receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
      ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society
      of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth
      thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of
      seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s look and behaviour. The
      happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single
      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth,
      meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the
      only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.
      And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for
      it.
    
    
      &ldquo;While I can have my mornings to myself,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is enough&mdash;I
      think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
      Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
      consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
      everybody.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not
      often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him
      whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s invitation, and if he did,
      whether he would think it proper to join in the evening&rsquo;s amusement; and
      she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever
      on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the
      Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that a ball of
      this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
      have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself,
      that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in
      the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting
      yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference
      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to
      any disrespect for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
      engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
      instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for
      it, however. Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a
      little longer, and Mr. Collins&rsquo;s proposal accepted with as good a grace as
      she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea
      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she
      was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of
      Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,
      in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to
      conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and
      heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and
      though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her
      charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the
      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her.
      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that
      a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might
      never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about
      him.
    
    
      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
      younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
      time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
      was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.
      No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after&mdash;the very
      shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
      found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
      improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a
      dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 18
    
    
      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain
      for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of
      his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him
      had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not
      unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care,
      and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained
      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in
      the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion
      of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s pleasure in the Bingleys&rsquo; 
      invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the
      absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom
      Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to
      go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding,
      with a significant smile, &ldquo;I do not imagine his business would have called
      him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman
      here.&rdquo;
     
    
      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
      Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
      Wickham&rsquo;s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
      of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
      disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the
      polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
      Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
      was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
      with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
      speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
    
    
      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of
      her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
      spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
      not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
      the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.
      The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising
      instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,
      gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a
      couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
    
    
      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
      Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
      were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
      her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her
      so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing
      what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she
      was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to
      console her:
    
    
      &ldquo;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To
      find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such
      an evil.&rdquo;
     
    
      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
      hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
      simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
      in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer,
      and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was
      arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in
      her neighbours&rsquo; looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood
      for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their
      silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not
      to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater
      punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight
      observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause
      of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:&mdash;&ldquo;It is your
      turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you
      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number
      of couples.&rdquo;
     
    
      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
      said.
    
    
      &ldquo;Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
      observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now
      we may be silent.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
      entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some,
      conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of
      saying as little as possible.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
      imagine that you are gratifying mine?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth archly; &ldquo;for I have always seen a great
      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
      disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that
      will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the
      eclat of a proverb.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You
      think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I must not decide on my own performance.&rdquo;
     
    
      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the
      dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to
      Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the
      temptation, added, &ldquo;When you met us there the other day, we had just been
      forming a new acquaintance.&rdquo;
     
    
      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
      features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
      for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
      constrained manner said, &ldquo;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
      as may ensure his making friends&mdash;whether he may be equally
      capable of retaining them, is less certain.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,&rdquo; replied
      Elizabeth with emphasis, &ldquo;and in a manner which he is likely to suffer
      from all his life.&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that
      moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through
      the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he
      stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing
      and his partner.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior
      dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first
      circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
      disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
      especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her
      sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow
      in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:&mdash;but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
      will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
      young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&rdquo;
     
    
      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
      William&rsquo;s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
      eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
      Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he
      turned to his partner, and said, &ldquo;Sir William&rsquo;s interruption has made me
      forget what we were talking of.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
      interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We
      have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are
      to talk of next I cannot imagine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What think you of books?&rdquo; said he, smiling.
    
    
      &ldquo;Books&mdash;oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
      same feelings.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
      no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
      something else.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The present always occupies you in such scenes&mdash;does it?&rdquo;
       said he, with a look of doubt.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, always,&rdquo; she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
      thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by
      her suddenly exclaiming, &ldquo;I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that
      you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
      unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, with a firm voice.
    
    
      &ldquo;And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to
      be secure of judging properly at first.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;May I ask to what these questions tend?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Merely to the illustration of your character,&rdquo; said she,
      endeavouring to shake off her gravity. &ldquo;I am trying to make it out.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what is your success?&rdquo;
     
    
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I do not get on at all. I hear such different
      accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can readily believe,&rdquo; answered he gravely, &ldquo;that reports may vary
      greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
      not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
      fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,&rdquo; he coldly replied.
      She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
      silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
      in Darcy&rsquo;s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
      which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
      another.
    
    
      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
      an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
    
    
      &ldquo;So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your
      sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
      questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
      his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
      Darcy&rsquo;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
      implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s using him
      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been
      remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a
      most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well
      that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear
      George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could
      not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was
      excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His
      coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I
      wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this
      discovery of your favourite&rsquo;s guilt; but really, considering his descent,
      one could not expect much better.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&rdquo; said
      Elizabeth angrily; &ldquo;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than
      of being the son of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s steward, and of that, I can assure
      you, he informed me himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
      &ldquo;Excuse my interference&mdash;it was kindly meant.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Insolent girl!&rdquo; said Elizabeth to herself. &ldquo;You are much mistaken if you
      expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in
      it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.&rdquo; She then
      sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same
      subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a
      glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was
      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read
      her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment
      against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of
      Jane&rsquo;s being in the fairest way for happiness.
    
    
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
      sister&rsquo;s, &ldquo;what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
      been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
      you may be sure of my pardon.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
      history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally
      offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity,
      and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has
      deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am
      sorry to say by his account as well as his sister&rsquo;s, Mr. Wickham is by no
      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and
      has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s regard.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied.
      But what does he say of the living?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them
      from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally
      only.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s sincerity,&rdquo; said Elizabeth warmly;
      &ldquo;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since
      he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the
      rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both
      gentlemen as I did before.&rdquo;
     
    
      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
      which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
      delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in
      it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to
      Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner
      she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her
      with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most
      important discovery.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have found out,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by a singular accident, that there is now in
      the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
      gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the
      house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
      Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
      thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh
      in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time
      for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he
      will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the
      connection must plead my apology.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I
      believe him to be Lady Catherine&rsquo;s nephew. It will be in my power
      to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&rsquo;nnight.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that
      Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an
      impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not
      in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that
      if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to
      begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined
      air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,
      replied thus:
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your
      excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding;
      but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the
      established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate
      the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical
      office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom&mdash;provided
      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You
      must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this
      occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.
      Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other
      subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I
      consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on
      what is right than a young lady like yourself.&rdquo; And with a low bow he left
      her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly
      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
      Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not
      hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of
      his lips the words &ldquo;apology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunsford,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&rdquo;
       It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing
      him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him
      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins,
      however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s contempt
      seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at
      the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
      Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have no reason, I assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to be dissatisfied with my
      reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
      me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
      that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s discernment as to be
      certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
      handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&rdquo;
     
    
      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
      her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train
      of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her
      perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very
      house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
      bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
      even to like Bingley&rsquo;s two sisters. Her mother&rsquo;s thoughts she plainly saw
      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest
      she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she
      considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of
      each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking
      to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but
      her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an
      animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young
      man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first
      points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how
      fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire
      the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising
      thing for her younger daughters, as Jane&rsquo;s marrying so greatly must throw
      them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her
      time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of
      their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than
      she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of
      pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was
      less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period
      of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might
      soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
      there was no chance of it.
    
    
      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&rsquo;s
      words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper;
      for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of
      it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only
      scolded her for being nonsensical.
    
    
      &ldquo;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure
      we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he
      may not like to hear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
      to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so
      doing!&rdquo;
     
    
      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
      talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
      blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
      glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
      she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
      convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
      of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
      steady gravity.
    
    
      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
      had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
      likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
      Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
      tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
      had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
      preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
      entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but
      in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting
      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
      on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through
      the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at
      their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the
      hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after
      the pause of half a minute began another. Mary&rsquo;s powers were by no means
      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.
      Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but
      Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two
      sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at
      Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her
      father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.
      He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
      &ldquo;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
      Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
      Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father&rsquo;s speech, was afraid
      her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
    
    
      &ldquo;If I,&rdquo; said Mr. Collins, &ldquo;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
      should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
      air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
      compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to
      assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,
      for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a
      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement
      for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his
      patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not
      be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his
      dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as
      possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have
      attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards
      those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;
      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of
      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.&rdquo; And
      with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so
      loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared&mdash;many smiled; but
      no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife
      seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and
      observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever,
      good kind of young man.
    
    
      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose
      themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been
      impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success;
      and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the
      exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a
      sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That
      his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of
      ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine
      whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of
      the ladies, were more intolerable.
    
    
      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
      Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
      could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power
      to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
      somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
      He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
      that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
      her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her
      greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
      good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&rsquo;s conversation to herself.
    
    
      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s further notice;
      though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
      disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
      probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.
    
    
      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a
      manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
      hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
      heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
      sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
      were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
      every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
      speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters
      on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness
      which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at
      all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and
      Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked
      only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.
      Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more
      than the occasional exclamation of &ldquo;Lord, how tired I am!&rdquo; accompanied by
      a violent yawn.
    
    
      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
      civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
      addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
      would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
      the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
      and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
      her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
      day for a short time.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
      delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
      settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
      see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
      months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
      with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
      Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
      man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each
      was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 19
    
    
      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
      declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his
      leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no
      feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
      moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
      observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
      Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after
      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
    
    
      &ldquo;May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
      when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course
      of this morning?&rdquo;
     
    
      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
      Bennet answered instantly, &ldquo;Oh dear!&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly. I am sure
      Lizzy will be very happy&mdash;I am sure she can have no objection. Come,
      Kitty, I want you up stairs.&rdquo; And, gathering her work together, she was
      hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:
    
    
      &ldquo;Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me.
      He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going
      away myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.&rdquo; And upon
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
      escape, she added: &ldquo;Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing
      Mr. Collins.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction&mdash;and a moment&rsquo;s
      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
      over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
      conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
      distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
      they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
    
    
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing
      you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have
      been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
      unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
      mother&rsquo;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of
      my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my
      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I
      entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
      But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it
      would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying&mdash;and,
      moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a
      wife, as I certainly did.&rdquo;
     
    
      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
      with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not
      use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he
      continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
      every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of
      matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add
      very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly&mdash;which perhaps I ought to
      have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
      recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
      patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
      too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
      left Hunsford&mdash;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson
      was arranging Miss de Bourgh&rsquo;s footstool, that she said, &lsquo;Mr. Collins, you
      must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a
      gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an
      active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a
      small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon
      as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&rsquo; Allow me, by the
      way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
      kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages
      in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can
      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,
      especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will
      inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of
      matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards
      Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there
      are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to
      inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,
      may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving
      to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be
      as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place&mdash;which,
      however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has
      been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me
      in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the
      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am
      perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your
      father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that
      one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till
      after your mother&rsquo;s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On
      that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure
      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are
      married.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are too hasty, sir,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You forget that I have made no
      answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
      the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your
      proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline
      them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not now to learn,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
      hand, &ldquo;that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
      man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
      favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
      third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
      said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sir,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;your hope is a rather extraordinary
      one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young
      ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
      happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly
      serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am
      convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.
      Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would
      find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&rdquo; said Mr. Collins
      very gravely&mdash;&ldquo;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
      disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing
      her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty,
      economy, and other amiable qualification.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give
      me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what
      I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do
      all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer,
      you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my
      family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,
      without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as
      finally settled.&rdquo; And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the
      room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:
    
    
      &ldquo;When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
      shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;
      though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it
      to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first
      application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my
      suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female
      character.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Collins,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &ldquo;you puzzle me
      exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of
      encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to
      convince you of its being one.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
      refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
      believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
      unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be
      any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with
      the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
      circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
      means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
      portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
      effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore
      conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose
      to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according
      to the usual practice of elegant females.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of
      elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be
      paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again
      for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is
      absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak
      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague
      you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are uniformly charming!&rdquo; cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;
      &ldquo;and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both
      your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.&rdquo;
     
    
      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
      reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
      persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
      encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in
      such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be
      mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 20
    
    
      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to
      watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door
      and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the
      breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on
      the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and
      returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to
      relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he
      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his
      cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful
      modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
    
    
      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad
      to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by
      protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could
      not help saying so.
    
    
      &ldquo;But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Lizzy shall be
      brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
      headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make
      her know it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,&rdquo; cried Mr. Collins; &ldquo;but if she is
      really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be
      a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for
      happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in
      rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting
      me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute
      much to my felicity.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Sir, you quite misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. &ldquo;Lizzy is
      only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
      good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
      we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.&rdquo;
     
    
      She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
      husband, called out as she entered the library, &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are
      wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy
      marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not
      make haste he will change his mind and not have her.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on
      her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her
      communication.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have not the pleasure of understanding you,&rdquo; said he, when she had
      finished her speech. &ldquo;Of what are you talking?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
      and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
      marrying him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.
    
    
      &ldquo;Come here, child,&rdquo; cried her father as she appeared. &ldquo;I have sent for you
      on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an
      offer of marriage. Is it true?&rdquo; Elizabeth replied that it was. &ldquo;Very well&mdash;and
      this offer of marriage you have refused?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have, sir.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
      accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, or I will never see her again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
      be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again
      if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if
      you do.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
      but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
      affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
    
    
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist
      upon her marrying him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;I have two small favours to request.
      First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
      present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
      library to myself as soon as may be.&rdquo;
     
    
      Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.
      Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed
      and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her
      interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and
      Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful
      gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her
      determination never did.
    
    
      Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He
      thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could
      refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.
      His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
      deserving her mother&rsquo;s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
    
    
      While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the
      day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her,
      cried in a half whisper, &ldquo;I am glad you are come, for there is such fun
      here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an
      offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who
      came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
      breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
      the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her
      to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.
      &ldquo;Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,&rdquo; she added in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;for nobody
      is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels
      for my poor nerves.&rdquo;
     
    
      Charlotte&rsquo;s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Aye, there she comes,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;looking as unconcerned as
      may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
      can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy&mdash;if you take it into
      your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will
      never get a husband at all&mdash;and I am sure I do not know who is to
      maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you&mdash;and
      so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the
      library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will
      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful
      children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.
      People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great
      inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always
      so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
      attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
      irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
      them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an
      air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the
      girls, &ldquo;Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues,
      and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
      Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
      detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
      herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
      curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not
      to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation:
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Collins!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;let us be for ever silent on this point. Far
      be it from me,&rdquo; he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
      displeasure, &ldquo;to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to
      inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
      who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust
      I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive
      happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often
      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied
      begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I
      hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,
      by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter&rsquo;s favour, without
      having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be
      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter&rsquo;s lips
      instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly
      meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an
      amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of
      all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I
      here beg leave to apologise.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 21
    
    
      The discussion of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s offer was now nearly at an end, and
      Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
      attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.
      As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed,
      not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
      stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her,
      and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were
      transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in
      listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to
      her friend.
    
    
      The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s ill-humour or ill
      health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
      had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
      not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
      Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
    
    
      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
      were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
      He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
      aunt&rsquo;s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
      well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that
      the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.
    
    
      &ldquo;I found,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr.
      Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many
      hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might
      arise unpleasant to more than myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
      discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed
      on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to
      Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His
      accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it
      offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of
      introducing him to her father and mother.
    
    
      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
      from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
      hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady&rsquo;s fair, flowing hand; and
      Elizabeth saw her sister&rsquo;s countenance change as she read it, and saw her
      dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself
      soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
      cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on
      the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner
      had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her
      to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking
      out the letter, said:
    
    
      &ldquo;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
      deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their
      way to town&mdash;and without any intention of coming back again. You
      shall hear what she says.&rdquo;
     
    
      She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of
      their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and
      of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.
      The next was in these words: &ldquo;I do not pretend to regret anything I shall
      leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we
      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful
      intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of
      separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend
      on you for that.&rdquo; To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with
      all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
      removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not
      to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was
      persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is unlucky,&rdquo; said she, after a short pause, &ldquo;that you should not be
      able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
      hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
      forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
      intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
      satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
      them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
      took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are
      certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles
      gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined
      on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant
      hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there
      for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had
      any intention of making one of the crowd&mdash;but of that I despair. I
      sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties
      which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so
      numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall
      deprive you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is evident by this,&rdquo; added Jane, &ldquo;that he comes back no more this
      winter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master.
      But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which
      particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we
      are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana
      Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
      affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something
      still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being
      hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you
      my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without
      confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My
      brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now
      of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the
      connection as much as his own; and a sister&rsquo;s partiality is not misleading
      me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman&rsquo;s
      heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing
      to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an
      event which will secure the happiness of so many?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?&rdquo; said Jane as
      she finished it. &ldquo;Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare
      that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
      perfectly convinced of her brother&rsquo;s indifference; and that if she
      suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
      put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Most willingly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
      in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
      town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does
      not care about you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane shook her head.
    
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
      together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is
      not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy
      for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is
      this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more
      anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there
      has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving
      a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it
      would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest
      Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her
      brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less
      sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday,
      or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in
      love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;your representation
      of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust.
      Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can
      hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
      will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
      You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
      elsewhere?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You must decide for yourself,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;and if, upon mature
      deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
      more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
      all means to refuse him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How can you talk so?&rdquo; said Jane, faintly smiling. &ldquo;You must know that
      though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
      not hesitate.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
      your situation with much compassion.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
      A thousand things may arise in six months!&rdquo;
     
    
      The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
      contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline&rsquo;s
      interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
      wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so
      totally independent of everyone.
    
    
      She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the
      subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane&rsquo;s
      temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the
      diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would
      return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
    
    
      They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
      family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman&rsquo;s conduct; but
      even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she
      bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go
      away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting
      it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley
      would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion
      of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited
      only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 22
    
    
      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
      chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
      Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &ldquo;It keeps him in good
      humour,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&rdquo;
       Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that
      it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very
      amiable, but Charlotte&rsquo;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any
      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any
      return of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such
      was Miss Lucas&rsquo;s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when
      they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he
      had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did
      injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to
      escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and
      hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to
      avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him
      depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not
      willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known
      likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte
      had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the
      adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering
      kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards
      the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But
      little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her
      there.
    
    
      In as short a time as Mr. Collins&rsquo;s long speeches would allow, everything
      was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered
      the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him
      the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the
      present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The
      stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship
      from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss
      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of
      an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.
    
    
      Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and
      it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins&rsquo;s present
      circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
      they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
      exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
      interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
      Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
      opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
      Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
      should make their appearance at St. James&rsquo;s. The whole family, in short,
      were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of
      coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
      done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&rsquo;s
      dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
      gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in
      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor
      agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
      imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
      either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
      the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and
      however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
      preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the
      age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the
      good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
      surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued
      beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably
      would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her
      feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her
      the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he
      returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before
      any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully
      given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity
      excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on
      his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same
      time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his
      prosperous love.
    
    
      As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
      family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
      for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said
      how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
      engagements might allow him to visit them.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this invitation is particularly gratifying,
      because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very
      certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     
    
      They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
      so speedy a return, immediately said:
    
    
      &ldquo;But is there not danger of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s disapprobation here, my good
      sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending
      your patroness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collins, &ldquo;I am particularly obliged to you for
      this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a
      step without her ladyship&rsquo;s concurrence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
      displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
      again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
      and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from
      me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard
      during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence
      may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the
      liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin
      Elizabeth.&rdquo;
     
    
      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
      surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
      understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
      younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She
      rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
      solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means
      so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve
      himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable
      companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done
      away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference
      with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
    
    
      The possibility of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s fancying himself in love with her friend
      had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that
      Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she
      could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so
      great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not
      help crying out:
    
    
      &ldquo;Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte&mdash;impossible!&rdquo;
     
    
      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
      story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
      reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
      her composure, and calmly replied:
    
    
      &ldquo;Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
      that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&rsquo;s good opinion,
      because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&rdquo;
     
    
      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for
      it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their
      relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all
      imaginable happiness.
    
    
      &ldquo;I see what you are feeling,&rdquo; replied Charlotte. &ldquo;You must be surprised,
      very much surprised&mdash;so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
      you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
      satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was.
      I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&rsquo;s character,
      connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of
      happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the
      marriage state.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth quietly answered &ldquo;Undoubtedly;&rdquo; and after an awkward pause, they
      returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer,
      and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a
      long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable
      a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s making two offers of marriage
      within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She
      had always felt that Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like
      her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into
      action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly
      advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating
      picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her
      esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for
      that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 23
    
    
      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she
      had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir
      William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her
      engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much
      self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he
      unfolded the matter&mdash;to an audience not merely wondering, but
      incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
      protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
      often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
    
    
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
      that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without
      anger such treatment; but Sir William&rsquo;s good breeding carried him through
      it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his
      information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most
      forbearing courtesy.
    
    
      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a
      situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning
      her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a
      stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of
      her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by
      Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be
      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the
      convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir
      William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a
      rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of
      the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken
      in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and
      fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however,
      were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real
      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously
      misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during
      the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.
      Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could
      see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could
      speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months
      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.
    
    
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as
      he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it
      gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been
      used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more
      foolish than his daughter!
    
    
      Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less
      of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor
      could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia
      were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman;
      and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at
      Meryton.
    
    
      Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
      Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called
      at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though
      Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to
      drive happiness away.
    
    
      Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
      mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real
      confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in
      Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose
      rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and
      for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been
      gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.
    
    
      Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the
      days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of
      thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and
      written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth&rsquo;s abode in
      the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that
      head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his
      happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour,
      Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of
      enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind
      wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to
      return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily
      approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as
      possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his
      amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.
    
    
      Mr. Collins&rsquo;s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure
      to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of
      it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn
      instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly
      troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was
      so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such
      were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the
      greater distress of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s continued absence.
    
    
      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day
      passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report
      which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield
      the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which
      she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.
    
    
      Even Elizabeth began to fear&mdash;not that Bingley was indifferent&mdash;but
      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
      was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane&rsquo;s happiness, and so
      dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
      frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and
      of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and
      the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength
      of his attachment.
    
    
      As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
      painful than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
      concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was
      never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour
      seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience
      for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come
      back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane&rsquo;s steady
      mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
    
    
      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
      first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and
      luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a
      great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at
      Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make
      an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
      anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
      wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss
      Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her
      with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she
      concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she
      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking
      of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters
      out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly
      of all this to her husband.
    
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is very hard to think that Charlotte
      Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
      make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better
      things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
      making any answer, she went on as before.
    
    
      &ldquo;I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
      not for the entail, I should not mind it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What should not you mind?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should not mind anything at all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
      insensibility.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
      anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one&rsquo;s own
      daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
      Why should he have it more than anybody else?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I leave it to yourself to determine,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 24
    
    
      Miss Bingley&rsquo;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
      sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
      the winter, and concluded with her brother&rsquo;s regret at not having had time
      to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the
      country.
    
    
      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
      the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
      writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&rsquo;s praise occupied the
      chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
      boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the
      accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.
      She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&rsquo;s being an inmate of Mr.
      Darcy&rsquo;s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with
      regard to new furniture.
    
    
      Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
      heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for
      her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline&rsquo;s assertion of
      her brother&rsquo;s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was
      really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much
      as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without
      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of
      proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends,
      and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their
      inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he
      might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought
      best, but her sister&rsquo;s was involved in it, as she thought he must be
      sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
      long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else;
      and yet whether Bingley&rsquo;s regard had really died away, or were suppressed
      by his friends&rsquo; interference; whether he had been aware of Jane&rsquo;s
      attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the
      case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the
      difference, her sister&rsquo;s situation remained the same, her peace equally
      wounded.
    
    
      A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
      Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s leaving them together, after a
      longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
      not help saying:
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
      idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I
      will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all
      be as we were before.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
      nothing.
    
    
      &ldquo;You doubt me,&rdquo; cried Jane, slightly colouring; &ldquo;indeed, you have no
      reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and
      nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A
      little time, therefore&mdash;I shall certainly try to get the better.&rdquo;
     
    
      With a stronger voice she soon added, &ldquo;I have this comfort immediately,
      that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
      has done no harm to anyone but myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Jane!&rdquo; exclaimed Elizabeth, &ldquo;you are too good. Your sweetness and
      disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I
      feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the
      praise on her sister&rsquo;s warm affection.
    
    
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;this is not fair. You wish to think all the
      world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to
      think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
      afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege
      of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really
      love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world,
      the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of
      the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence
      that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with
      two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte&rsquo;s
      marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin
      your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of
      situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins&rsquo;s respectability, and
      Charlotte&rsquo;s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large
      family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to
      believe, for everybody&rsquo;s sake, that she may feel something like regard and
      esteem for our cousin.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
      could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
      Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
      understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
      conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I
      do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
      cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it
      is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change
      the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself
      or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security
      for happiness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,&rdquo; replied Jane;
      &ldquo;and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But
      enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two
      instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not
      to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your
      opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves
      intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always
      so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity
      that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And men take care that they should.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of
      there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s conduct to design,&rdquo;
       said Elizabeth; &ldquo;but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
      unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
      want of attention to other people&rsquo;s feelings, and want of resolution, will
      do the business.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And do you impute it to either of those?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I
      think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, in conjunction with his friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only
      wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure
      it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
      happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may
      wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
      connections, and pride.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,&rdquo; replied
      Jane; &ldquo;but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They
      have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
      her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
      they should have opposed their brother&rsquo;s. What sister would think herself
      at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If
      they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he
      were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not
      distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken&mdash;or,
      at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel
      in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light,
      in the light in which it may be understood.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s
      name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more,
      and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it
      clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less
      perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not
      believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of
      a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but
      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had
      the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s best comfort was that
      Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
    
    
      Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. &ldquo;So, Lizzy,&rdquo; said he one day,
      &ldquo;your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being
      married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is
      something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her
      companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long
      outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to
      disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your
      man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
      all expect Jane&rsquo;s good fortune.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
      that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
      the most of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
      which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
      family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added
      that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard,
      his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now
      openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to
      know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known
      anything of the matter.
    
    
      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
      extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
      Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances,
      and urged the possibility of mistakes&mdash;but by everybody else Mr.
      Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 25
    
    
      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
      Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.
      The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by
      preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope,
      that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed
      that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations
      at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins
      health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of
      thanks.
    
    
      On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
      brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
      Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
      superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
      ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
      trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred
      and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.
      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and
      a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest
      and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had
      frequently been staying with her in town.
    
    
      The first part of Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s business on her arrival was to
      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
      done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
      Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
      had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls
      had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in
      it.
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not blame Jane,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley
      if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she
      might have been Mr. Collins&rsquo;s wife by this time, had it not been for her
      own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused
      him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter
      married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much
      entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They
      are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
      It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family,
      and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
      However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I
      am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
      the course of Jane and Elizabeth&rsquo;s correspondence with her, made her
      sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
      conversation.
    
    
      When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. &ldquo;It
      seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am
      sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as
      you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a
      few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that
      these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;An excellent consolation in its way,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;but it will not do
      for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often
      happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
      independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
      love with only a few days before.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But that expression of &lsquo;violently in love&rsquo; is so hackneyed, so doubtful,
      so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied
      to feelings which arise from a half-hour&rsquo;s acquaintance, as to a real,
      strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they
      met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two
      or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him
      twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms?
      Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
      Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not
      get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy;
      you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
      would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
      service&mdash;and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
      anything.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
      of her sister&rsquo;s ready acquiescence.
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gardiner, &ldquo;that no consideration with regard to this
      young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all
      our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so
      little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he
      really comes to see her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
      friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
      part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
      perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
      would hardly think a month&rsquo;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
      impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
      never stirs without him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
      correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She will drop the acquaintance entirely.&rdquo;
     
    
      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
      point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley&rsquo;s being
      withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
      convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
      hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his
      affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
      successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&rsquo;s attractions.
    
    
      Miss Bennet accepted her aunt&rsquo;s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys
      were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by
      Caroline&rsquo;s not living in the same house with her brother, she might
      occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.
    
    
      The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
      the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.
      Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother
      and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the
      engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it&mdash;of
      which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,
      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&rsquo;s warm commendation,
      narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to
      be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough
      to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the
      subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence
      of encouraging such an attachment.
    
    
      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected
      with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her
      marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of
      Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances
      in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of
      Darcy&rsquo;s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence
      of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
      of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
      description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
      praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him
      and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman&rsquo;s reputed
      disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident
      at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly
      spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 26
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
      the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly
      telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
    
    
      &ldquo;You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
      are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.
      Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or
      endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would
      make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a
      most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I
      should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your
      fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
      Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am
      sure. You must not disappoint your father.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself,
      and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent
      it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Elizabeth, you are not serious now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr.
      Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the
      most agreeable man I ever saw&mdash;and if he becomes really attached to
      me&mdash;I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the
      imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father&rsquo;s
      opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to
      forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my
      dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you
      unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young
      people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of
      my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
      would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
      to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
      object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I
      will do my best.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
      often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting
      him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;As I did the other day,&rdquo; said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: &ldquo;very
      true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not
      imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has
      been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&rsquo;s ideas as to the
      necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
      honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you
      are satisfied.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
      the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
      being given on such a point, without being resented.
    
    
      Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by
      the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his
      arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now
      fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it
      inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she &ldquo;wished
      they might be happy.&rdquo; Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday
      Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave,
      Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother&rsquo;s ungracious and reluctant good wishes,
      and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they
      went downstairs together, Charlotte said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That you certainly shall.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
      come to Hunsford.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
      visit.
    
    
      &ldquo;My father and Maria are coming to me in March,&rdquo; added Charlotte, &ldquo;and I
      hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
      welcome as either of them.&rdquo;
     
    
      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the
      church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject
      as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence
      was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally
      unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without
      feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined
      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been,
      rather than what was. Charlotte&rsquo;s first letters were received with a good
      deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would
      speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy
      she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were
      read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point
      exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed
      surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not
      praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her
      taste, and Lady Catherine&rsquo;s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It
      was Mr. Collins&rsquo;s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and
      Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the
      rest.
    
    
      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe
      arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be
      in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
    
    
      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
      generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
      hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
      her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
      lost.
    
    
      &ldquo;My aunt,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is going to-morrow into that part of the town,
      and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.&rdquo;
     
    
      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I
      did not think Caroline in spirits,&rdquo; were her words, &ldquo;but she was very glad
      to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to
      London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I
      inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged
      with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy
      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as
      Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon
      here.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident
      only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister&rsquo;s being in town.
    
    
      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
      persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
      blind to Miss Bingley&rsquo;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
      for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
      visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
      the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
      prove what she felt.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
      better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
      entirely deceived in Miss Bingley&rsquo;s regard for me. But, my dear sister,
      though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
      still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
      as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
      wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
      happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
      return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive
      in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no
      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,
      said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
      altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to
      continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming
      her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say
      that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because
      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure
      that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself
      farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet
      if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on
      his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her
      having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we
      must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of
      talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to
      Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging
      harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong
      appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every
      painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy&mdash;your
      affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me
      hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have
      such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,
      with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.&mdash;Yours,
      etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
      considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All
      expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even
      wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review
      of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to
      Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s sister,
      as by Wickham&rsquo;s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had
      thrown away.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning
      that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send
      as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent
      partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of
      some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could
      see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but
      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she
      would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden
      acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the
      young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth,
      less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte&rsquo;s, did not
      quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary,
      could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few
      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.
    
    
      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
      circumstances, she thus went on: &ldquo;I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I
      have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and
      elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him
      all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him;
      they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate
      her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good
      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been
      effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to
      all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say
      that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be
      purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to
      heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open
      to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
      to live on as well as the plain.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 27
    
    
      With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
      diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
      sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
      Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
      going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
      and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as
      well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
      Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was
      novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable
      sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome
      for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and,
      in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any
      delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled
      according to Charlotte&rsquo;s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William
      and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was
      added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.
    
    
      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and
      who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told
      her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
    
    
      The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
      his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
      Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
      first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of
      bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she
      was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of
      her&mdash;their opinion of everybody&mdash;would always coincide, there
      was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him
      with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
      whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and
      pleasing.
    
    
      Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
      him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
      good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
      that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
      delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she
      had known Sir William&rsquo;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the
      wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
      out, like his information.
    
    
      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as
      to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s door,
      Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they
      entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking
      earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.
      On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for
      their cousin&rsquo;s appearance would not allow them to wait in the
      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a
      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The
      day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and
      the evening at one of the theatres.
    
    
      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
      sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her
      minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
      spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
      hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
      particulars also of Miss Bingley&rsquo;s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
      repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
      herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
      acquaintance.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham&rsquo;s desertion, and
      complimented her on bearing it so well.
    
    
      &ldquo;But my dear Elizabeth,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;what sort of girl is Miss King? I
      should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
      between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
      and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
      because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl
      with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
      what to think.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather&rsquo;s death
      made her mistress of this fortune.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No&mdash;why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my
      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making
      love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
      soon after this event.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
      decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to
      it, why should we?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her
      being deficient in something herself&mdash;sense or feeling.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;have it as you choose. He shall be
      mercenary, and she shall be foolish.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you
      know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
      Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
      much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
      where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
      neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
      worth knowing, after all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.&rdquo;
     
    
      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
      unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a
      tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
    
    
      &ldquo;We have not determined how far it shall carry us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner,
      &ldquo;but, perhaps, to the Lakes.&rdquo;
     
    
      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance
      of the invitation was most ready and grateful. &ldquo;Oh, my dear, dear aunt,&rdquo;
       she rapturously cried, &ldquo;what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh
      life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to
      rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when
      we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being
      able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we
      have gone&mdash;we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes,
      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations;
      nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin
      quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be
      less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 28
    
    
      Every object in the next day&rsquo;s journey was new and interesting to
      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen
      her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the
      prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
    
    
      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
      search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
      The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
      smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
    
    
      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,
      the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
      everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared
      at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a
      short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
      party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight
      of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
      pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she
      found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
      cousin&rsquo;s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was
      just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to
      hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with
      no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken
      into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them
      a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and
      punctually repeated all his wife&rsquo;s offers of refreshment.
    
    
      Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in
      fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
      and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing
      to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything
      seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh
      of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could
      have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said
      anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly
      was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or
      twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did
      not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture
      in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their
      journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them
      to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to
      the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was
      one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command
      of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the
      exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading
      the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
      interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
      with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
      fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the
      most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the
      country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect
      of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park
      nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building,
      well situated on rising ground.
    
    
      From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
      but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
      frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took
      her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to
      have the opportunity of showing it without her husband&rsquo;s help. It was
      rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up
      and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave
      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was
      really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte&rsquo;s evident
      enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.
    
    
      She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
      was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
      in, observed:
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de
      Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be
      delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt
      not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service
      is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and
      my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your
      stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at
      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her
      ladyship&rsquo;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one
      of her ladyship&rsquo;s carriages, for she has several.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&rdquo; added
      Charlotte, &ldquo;and a most attentive neighbour.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman
      whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&rdquo;
     
    
      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
      telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
      Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
      Charlotte&rsquo;s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
      and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was
      all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass,
      the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of
      Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively
      imagination soon settled it all.
    
    
      About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for
      a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion;
      and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a
      violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met
      Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
      there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
      haste, and come down this moment.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and
      down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of
      this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden
      gate.
    
    
      &ldquo;And is this all?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;I expected at least that the pigs
      were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
      daughter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;La! my dear,&rdquo; said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, &ldquo;it is not Lady
      Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other
      is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who
      would have thought that she could be so thin and small?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
      Why does she not come in?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
      when Miss de Bourgh comes in.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I like her appearance,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. &ldquo;She
      looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make
      him a very proper wife.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
      with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth&rsquo;s high diversion, was
      stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before
      him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.
    
    
      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the
      others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls
      than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte
      explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at
      Rosings the next day.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 29
    
    
      Mr. Collins&rsquo;s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
      The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
      visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
      wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing
      it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
    
    
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I should not have been at all surprised by her
      ladyship&rsquo;s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
      Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
      would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
      could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an
      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your
      arrival!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am the less surprised at what has happened,&rdquo; replied Sir William, &ldquo;from
      that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my
      situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
      instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.&rdquo;
     
    
      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
      visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they
      were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so
      splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
    
    
      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
      Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes
      herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of
      your clothes is superior to the rest&mdash;there is no occasion for
      anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being
      simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.&rdquo;
     
    
      While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
      doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
      objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
      her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who
      had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
      introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
      to his presentation at St. James&rsquo;s.
    
    
      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
      across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
      Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
      raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
      slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house,
      and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir
      Lewis de Bourgh.
    
    
      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&rsquo;s alarm was every moment
      increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that
      spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and
      the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness
      without trepidation.
    
    
      From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous
      air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the
      servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her
      daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great
      condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
      with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
      performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
      which he would have thought necessary.
    
    
      In spite of having been at St. James&rsquo;s, Sir William was so completely awed
      by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to
      make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his
      daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her
      chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal
      to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
      Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,
      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was
      her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their
      inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever
      she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her
      self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind;
      and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady
      Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
    
    
      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she
      soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
      daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria&rsquo;s astonishment at her
      being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
      likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
      features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little,
      except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was
      nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she
      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.
    
    
      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
      admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and
      Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking
      at in the summer.
    
    
      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
      all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
      likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
      ladyship&rsquo;s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
      nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity;
      and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who
      was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner
      which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine
      seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious
      smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.
      The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak
      whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and
      Miss de Bourgh&mdash;the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady
      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs.
      Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate,
      pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria
      thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but
      eat and admire.
    
    
      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done
      but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission
      till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so
      decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement
      controverted. She inquired into Charlotte&rsquo;s domestic concerns familiarly
      and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them
      all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as
      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
      Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady&rsquo;s attention,
      which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the
      intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of
      questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose
      connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a
      very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how
      many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself,
      whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome,
      where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had
      been her mother&rsquo;s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
      questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,
    
    
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,&rdquo;
       turning to Charlotte, &ldquo;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion
      for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary
      in Sir Lewis de Bourgh&rsquo;s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! then&mdash;some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to&mdash;&mdash;You shall
      try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;One of them does.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs
      all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you
      draw?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What, none of you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
      should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Has your governess left you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We never had any governess.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
      without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have
      been quite a slave to your education.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
      the case.
    
    
      &ldquo;Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must
      have been neglected.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished
      to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and
      had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle,
      certainly might.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
      known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
      one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
      and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
      wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
      way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
      of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it
      was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was
      merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted
      with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf&rsquo;s calling yesterday
      to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &lsquo;Lady Catherine,&rsquo; said she,
      &lsquo;you have given me a treasure.&rsquo; Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss
      Bennet?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
      younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
      must be very young?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be
      much in company. But really, ma&rsquo;am, I think it would be very hard upon
      younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
      amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
      marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
      as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it
      would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
      mind.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said her ladyship, &ldquo;you give your opinion very decidedly
      for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With three younger sisters grown up,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, smiling, &ldquo;your
      ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
      and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
      dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
    
    
      &ldquo;You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal
      your age.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not one-and-twenty.&rdquo;
     
    
      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were
      placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to
      quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls
      had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their
      table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did
      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of
      Miss de Bourgh&rsquo;s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too
      little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine
      was generally speaking&mdash;stating the mistakes of the three others, or
      relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to
      everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and
      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much.
      He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
    
    
      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the
      tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
      gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round
      the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have
      on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival
      of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins&rsquo;s side
      and as many bows on Sir William&rsquo;s they departed. As soon as they had
      driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her
      opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte&rsquo;s sake,
      she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though
      costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he
      was very soon obliged to take her ladyship&rsquo;s praise into his own hands.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 30
    
    
      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough
      to convince him of his daughter&rsquo;s being most comfortably settled, and of
      her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
      with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to
      driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went
      away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth
      was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the
      alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now
      passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and
      looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.
      The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first
      rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for
      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect;
      but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did,
      for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own
      apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte
      credit for the arrangement.
    
    
      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were
      indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along,
      and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he
      never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every
      day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes&rsquo; 
      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get
      out.
    
    
      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not
      many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till
      Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be
      disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now
      and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing
      escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised
      them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the
      furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted
      any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that
      Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s joints of meat were too large for her family.
    
    
      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
      commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in
      her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr.
      Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
      quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village
      to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into
      harmony and plenty.
    
    
      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
      and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
      card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
      the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the
      neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins&rsquo;s reach. This, however,
      was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
      comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
      Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
      often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along
      the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice
      sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she
      felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s curiosity.
    
    
      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
      Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition
      to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.
      Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected
      there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her
      acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one
      comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be
      amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley&rsquo;s designs on him were, by his
      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady
      Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke
      of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find
      that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.
    
    
      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
      the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in
      order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as
      the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
      intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
      respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
      Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
      his uncle Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and, to the great surprise of all the
      party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte
      had seen them from her husband&rsquo;s room, crossing the road, and immediately
      running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect,
      adding:
    
    
      &ldquo;I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never
      have come so soon to wait upon me.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
      before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
      afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who
      led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address
      most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to
      look in Hertfordshire&mdash;paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,
      to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met
      her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him
      without saying a word.
    
    
      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness
      and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin,
      after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to
      Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length,
      however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after
      the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, added:
    
    
      &ldquo;My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
      happened to see her there?&rdquo;
     
    
      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
      whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
      Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
      answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
      subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
      away.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 31
    
    
      Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and
      the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of
      their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
      received any invitation thither&mdash;for while there were visitors in the
      house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost
      a week after the gentlemen&rsquo;s arrival, that they were honoured by such an
      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there
      in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady
      Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage
      more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at
      church.
    
    
      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
      the party in Lady Catherine&rsquo;s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them
      civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable
      as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed
      by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to
      any other person in the room.
    
    
      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome
      relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s pretty friend had moreover
      caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so
      agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of
      new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well
      entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit
      and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as
      of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards
      them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while,
      shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple
      to call out:
    
    
      &ldquo;What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of?
      What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We are speaking of music, madam,&rdquo; said he, when no longer able to avoid a
      reply.
    
    
      &ldquo;Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must
      have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are
      few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music
      than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should
      have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed
      her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister&rsquo;s proficiency.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,&rdquo; said Lady Catherine;
      &ldquo;and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does
      not practice a good deal.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I assure you, madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that she does not need such advice.
      She practises very constantly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to
      her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell
      young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
      constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will
      never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins
      has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come
      to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson&rsquo;s room.
      She would be in nobody&rsquo;s way, you know, in that part of the house.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt&rsquo;s ill-breeding, and made no
      answer.
    
    
      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
      promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
      drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
      talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
      her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
      stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&rsquo;s
      countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient
      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
      me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.
      There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
      the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
      me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall not say you are mistaken,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because you could not
      really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had
      the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great
      enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your
      own.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel
      Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and
      teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in
      meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of
      the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.
      Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you
      knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire&mdash;and, give me leave to say,
      very impolitic too&mdash;for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; said he, smilingly.
    
    
      &ldquo;Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,&rdquo; cried Colonel
      Fitzwilliam. &ldquo;I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You shall hear then&mdash;but prepare yourself for something very
      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must
      know, was at a ball&mdash;and at this ball, what do you think he did? He
      danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
      knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.
      Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
      beyond my own party.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
      Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;I should have judged better, had I sought an
      introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?&rdquo; said Elizabeth, still
      addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. &ldquo;Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
      education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
      himself to strangers?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can answer your question,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;without applying to him.
      It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&rdquo; said Darcy,
      &ldquo;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch
      their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I
      often see done.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My fingers,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;do not move over this instrument in the
      masterly manner which I see so many women&rsquo;s do. They have not the same
      force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have
      always supposed it to be my own fault&mdash;because I will not take the
      trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers
      as capable as any other woman&rsquo;s of superior execution.&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy smiled and said, &ldquo;You are perfectly right. You have employed your
      time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
      think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.&rdquo;
     
    
      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what
      they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady
      Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to
      Darcy:
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could
      have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of
      fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne&rsquo;s. Anne would have been a
      delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin&rsquo;s
      praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any
      symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she
      derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as
      likely to marry her, had she been his relation.
    
    
      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth&rsquo;s performance, mixing
      with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
      them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
      gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship&rsquo;s carriage was
      ready to take them all home.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 32
    
    
      Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
      while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when
      she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.
      As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady
      Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished
      letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door
      opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,
      entered the room.
    
    
      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
      intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
      to be within.
    
    
      They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed
      in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary,
      therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when
      she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what
      he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:
    
    
      &ldquo;How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
      It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all
      after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.
      He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perfectly so, I thank you.&rdquo;
     
    
      She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
      pause added:
    
    
      &ldquo;I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
      returning to Netherfield again?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very
      little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a
      time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
      neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might
      possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not
      take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his
      own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;if he were to give it up as soon
      as any eligible purchase offers.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend;
      and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble
      of finding a subject to him.
    
    
      He took the hint, and soon began with, &ldquo;This seems a very comfortable
      house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins
      first came to Hunsford.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe she did&mdash;and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
      kindness on a more grateful object.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
      the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him
      happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding&mdash;though I
      am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
      thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
      prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance
      of her own family and friends.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day&rsquo;s
      journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
      of the match,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;I should never have said Mrs. Collins was
      settled near her family.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
      the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.&rdquo;
     
    
      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.
      The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying
      circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling
      unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here.
      Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will
      allow of frequent journeys&mdash;and I am persuaded my friend would not
      call herself near her family under less than half the
      present distance.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, &ldquo;You
      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You
      cannot have been always at Longbourn.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
      feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
      glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
    
    
      &ldquo;Are you pleased with Kent?&rdquo;
     
    
      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm
      and concise&mdash;and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and
      her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them.
      Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss
      Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to
      anybody, went away.
    
    
      &ldquo;What can be the meaning of this?&rdquo; said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.
      &ldquo;My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have
      called us in this familiar way.&rdquo;
     
    
      But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even
      to Charlotte&rsquo;s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they
      could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of
      finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.
      All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books,
      and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in
      the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or
      of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from
      this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various
      times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now
      and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel
      Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion
      which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by
      her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident
      admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in
      comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel
      Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.
    
    
      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to
      understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten
      minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
      seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice&mdash;a sacrifice to
      propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated.
      Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s
      occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally
      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as
      she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the
      object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to
      find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever
      he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her
      friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It
      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were
      much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of
      mind.
    
    
      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being
      partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins
      did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising
      expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it
      admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend&rsquo;s dislike would vanish, if
      she could suppose him to be in her power.
    
    
      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
      Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
      certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
      to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
      in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 33
    
    
      More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
      meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should
      bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever
      happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite
      haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
      Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a
      voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal
      inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it
      necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor
      did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it
      struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some
      odd unconnected questions&mdash;about her pleasure in being at Hunsford,
      her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s
      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly
      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into
      Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to
      imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed,
      if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that
      quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find
      herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.
    
    
      She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane&rsquo;s last letter, and
      dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
      spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on
      looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
      letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I did not know before that you ever walked this way.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have been making the tour of the park,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;as I generally do
      every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you
      going much farther?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I should have turned in a moment.&rdquo;
     
    
      And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
      together.
    
    
      &ldquo;Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?&rdquo; said she.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal.
      He arranges the business just as he pleases.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
      pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
      more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He likes to have his own way very well,&rdquo; replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
      &ldquo;But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than
      many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
      feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
      dependence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
      Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
      When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you
      chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;These are home questions&mdash;and perhaps I cannot say that I have
      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
      weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
      they like.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
      do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my
      rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; thought Elizabeth, &ldquo;meant for me?&rdquo; and she coloured at the
      idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, &ldquo;And pray, what is
      the usual price of an earl&rsquo;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very
      sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     
    
      He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a
      silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she
      soon afterwards said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
      having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
      lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
      for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
      likes with her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Colonel Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;that is an advantage which he must divide
      with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
      charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
      little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may
      like to have her own way.&rdquo;
     
    
      As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in
      which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give
      them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got
      pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
    
    
      &ldquo;You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say
      she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very
      great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man&mdash;he
      is a great friend of Darcy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth drily; &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
      Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in
      those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
      our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
      him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
      Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is it you mean?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
      because if it were to get round to the lady&rsquo;s family, it would be an
      unpleasant thing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You may depend upon my not mentioning it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.
      What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having
      lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent
      marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I
      only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man
      to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been
      together the whole of last summer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
      lady.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what arts did he use to separate them?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He did not talk to me of his own arts,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, smiling. &ldquo;He
      only told me what I have now told you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
      indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
      was so thoughtful.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am thinking of what you have been telling me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your cousin&rsquo;s
      conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
      friend&rsquo;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
      determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,&rdquo; she
      continued, recollecting herself, &ldquo;as we know none of the particulars, it
      is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much
      affection in the case.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is not an unnatural surmise,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;but it is a
      lessening of the honour of my cousin&rsquo;s triumph very sadly.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.
      Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore,
      abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until
      they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as
      their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that
      she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be
      meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the
      world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless
      influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate
      Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to
      Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own
      vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride
      and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still
      continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for
      the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say
      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
    
    
      &ldquo;There were some very strong objections against the lady,&rdquo; were Colonel
      Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having
      one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in
      London.
    
    
      &ldquo;To Jane herself,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there could be no possibility of
      objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!&mdash;her understanding
      excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could
      anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities,
      has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which
      he will probably never reach.&rdquo; When she thought of her mother, her
      confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections
      there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was
      convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his
      friend&rsquo;s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite
      decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of
      pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.
    
    
      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
      headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
      her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
      cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
      seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as
      possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could
      not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s being rather displeased
      by her staying at home.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 34
    
    
      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
      much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
      examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
      being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
      revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
      But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
      cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
      proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
      noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention
      which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s shameful
      boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense
      of her sister&rsquo;s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his
      visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next&mdash;and, a still
      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane
      again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all
      that affection could do.
    
    
      She could not think of Darcy&rsquo;s leaving Kent without remembering that his
      cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that
      he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to
      be unhappy about him.
    
    
      While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
      door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
      being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the
      evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this
      idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected,
      when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an
      hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing
      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with
      cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked
      about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a
      silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and
      thus began:
    
    
      &ldquo;In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
      repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
      you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
      doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and
      the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately
      followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
      heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
      tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority&mdash;of its being
      a degradation&mdash;of the family obstacles which had always opposed to
      inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
      consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.
    
    
      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the
      compliment of such a man&rsquo;s affection, and though her intentions did not
      vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
      receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
      all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer
      him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all
      his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing
      his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As
      he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable
      answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance
      expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate
      farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she
      said:
    
    
      &ldquo;In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express
      a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they
      may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I
      could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot&mdash;I
      have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it
      most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has
      been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short
      duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
      acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it
      after this explanation.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on
      her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.
      His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was
      visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of
      composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have
      attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth&rsquo;s feelings dreadful. At length,
      with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
    
    
      &ldquo;And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
      might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour
      at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I might as well inquire,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;why with so evident a desire of
      offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against
      your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not
      this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other
      provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you&mdash;had
      they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means
      of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?&rdquo;
     
    
      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
      was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
      continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
      excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare
      not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only
      means of dividing them from each other&mdash;of exposing one to the
      censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its
      derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the
      acutest kind.&rdquo;
     
    
      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with
      an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even
      looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
    
    
      &ldquo;Can you deny that you have done it?&rdquo; she repeated.
    
    
      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: &ldquo;I have no wish of denying that
      I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or
      that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than
      towards myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but
      its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
    
    
      &ldquo;But it is not merely this affair,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;on which my dislike is
      founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.
      Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months
      ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what
      imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what
      misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You take an eager interest in that gentleman&rsquo;s concerns,&rdquo; said Darcy, in
      a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
    
    
      &ldquo;Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
      interest in him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;His misfortunes!&rdquo; repeated Darcy contemptuously; &ldquo;yes, his misfortunes
      have been great indeed.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And of your infliction,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth with energy. &ldquo;You have reduced
      him to his present state of poverty&mdash;comparative poverty. You have
      withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.
      You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which
      was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you
      can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
      &ldquo;is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
      thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
      calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,&rdquo; added he, stopping in his
      walk, and turning towards her, &ldquo;these offenses might have been overlooked,
      had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that
      had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations
      might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my
      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by
      unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by
      everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed
      of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me
      to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?&mdash;to congratulate
      myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly
      beneath my own?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
      the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
    
    
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
      declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
      which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
      gentlemanlike manner.&rdquo;
     
    
      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
      would have tempted me to accept it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
    
    
      &ldquo;From the very beginning&mdash;from the first moment, I may almost say&mdash;of
      my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
      belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
      feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation
      on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had
      not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the
      world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings,
      and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for
      having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your
      health and happiness.&rdquo;
     
    
      And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the
      next moment open the front door and quit the house.
    
    
      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to
      support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
      half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
      increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
      marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so
      many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the
      objections which had made him prevent his friend&rsquo;s marrying her sister,
      and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case&mdash;was
      almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so
      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride&mdash;his
      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane&mdash;his
      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
      and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
      cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity
      which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She
      continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte&rsquo;s
      observation, and hurried her away to her room.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 35
    
    
      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
      which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
      surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
      else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
      breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
      directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she
      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park
      paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the
      gates into the ground.
    
    
      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
      tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look
      into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a
      great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure
      of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she
      caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the
      park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was
      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to
      see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had
      turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved
      it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time
      reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,
      said, with a look of haughty composure, &ldquo;I have been walking in the grove
      some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading
      that letter?&rdquo; And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the
      plantation, and was soon out of sight.
    
    
      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
      Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
      perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite
      through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full.
      Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from
      Rosings, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and was as follows:&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
      its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
      offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
      intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which,
      for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort
      which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should
      have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand
      it of your justice.
    
    
      &ldquo;Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
      that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
      from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
      claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
      prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly
      to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite
      of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on
      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would
      be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose
      affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no
      comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so
      liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
      the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
      motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to
      myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
      offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be
      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
    
    
      &ldquo;I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
      others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman
      in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at
      Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
      attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had
      the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
      William Lucas&rsquo;s accidental information, that Bingley&rsquo;s attentions to your
      sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke
      of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From
      that moment I observed my friend&rsquo;s behaviour attentively; and I could then
      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever
      witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were
      open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
      regard, and I remained convinced from the evening&rsquo;s scrutiny, that though
      she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any
      participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I
      must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make
      the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to
      inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I
      shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister&rsquo;s
      countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a
      conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to
      be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
      certain&mdash;but I will venture to say that my investigation and
      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not
      believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on
      impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to
      the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
      the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
      connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there
      were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and
      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to
      forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be
      stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother&rsquo;s family, though
      objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety
      so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three
      younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains
      me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest
      relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it
      give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as
      to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
      bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense
      and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed
      that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
      inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my
      friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield
      for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the
      design of soon returning.
    
    
      &ldquo;The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters&rsquo; uneasiness
      had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon
      discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching
      their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We
      accordingly went&mdash;and there I readily engaged in the office of
      pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described,
      and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have
      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would
      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the
      assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister&rsquo;s indifference.
      He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not
      with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
      dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore,
      that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him
      against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
      was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done
      thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on
      which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to
      adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister&rsquo;s
      being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
      brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill
      consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
      enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was
      done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other
      apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister&rsquo;s feelings, it was
      unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very
      naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
    
    
      &ldquo;With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
      Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
      connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I
      am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
      than one witness of undoubted veracity.
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
      the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the
      discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to
      him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore
      liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at
      Cambridge&mdash;most important assistance, as his own father, always poor
      from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
      gentleman&rsquo;s education. My father was not only fond of this young man&rsquo;s
      society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest
      opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to
      provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first
      began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities&mdash;the
      want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his
      best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the
      same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in
      unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give
      you pain&mdash;to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the
      sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature
      shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character&mdash;it adds even
      another motive.
    
    
      &ldquo;My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.
      Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
      recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that
      his profession might allow&mdash;and if he took orders, desired that a
      valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was
      also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive
      mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to
      inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I
      should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
      pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
      benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be
      aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
      insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be
      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
      I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was
      therefore soon settled&mdash;he resigned all claim to assistance in the
      church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive
      it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between
      us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to
      Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
      lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
      from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me
      again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me,
      and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had
      found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved
      on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question&mdash;of
      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that
      I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my
      revered father&rsquo;s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to
      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His
      resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances&mdash;and
      he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his
      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance
      was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most
      painfully obtruded on my notice.
    
    
      &ldquo;I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
      and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
      to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
      secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the
      guardianship of my mother&rsquo;s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About
      a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her
      in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to
      Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for
      there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her
      connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose
      affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as
      a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent
      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and
      after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge
      of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of
      grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
      acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
      Regard for my sister&rsquo;s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure;
      but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s chief object
      was unquestionably my sister&rsquo;s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds;
      but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a
      strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.
    
    
      &ldquo;This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been
      concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you
      will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know
      not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you;
      but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you
      previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in
      your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
    
    
      &ldquo;You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I
      was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be
      revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near
      relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the
      executors of my father&rsquo;s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every
      particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should
      make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same
      cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility
      of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting
      this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add,
      God bless you.
    
    
      &ldquo;FITZWILLIAM DARCY&rdquo; 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 36
    
    
      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
      contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
      its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
      she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her
      feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she
      first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and
      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give,
      which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice
      against everything he might say, she began his account of what had
      happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her
      power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
      sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one
      before her eyes. His belief of her sister&rsquo;s insensibility she instantly
      resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to
      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He
      expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style
      was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.
    
    
      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham&mdash;when
      she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if
      true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore
      so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself&mdash;her feelings
      were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
      Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to
      discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, &ldquo;This must be false! This
      cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!&rdquo;&mdash;and when she had
      gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
      last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
      regard it, that she would never look in it again.
    
    
      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing,
      she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was
      unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again
      began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded
      herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of
      his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related
      himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before
      known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each
      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference
      was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory,
      and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that
      there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few
      moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she
      read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately
      following of Wickham&rsquo;s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his
      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again
      was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every
      circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality&mdash;deliberated on
      the probability of each statement&mdash;but with little success. On both
      sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more
      clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
      contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s conduct in it less
      than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely
      blameless throughout the whole.
    
    
      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
      bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
      entrance into the &mdash;&mdash;shire Militia, in which he had engaged at
      the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
      had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing
      had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real
      character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of
      inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once
      in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of
      goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might
      rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance
      of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour
      to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many
      years&rsquo; continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see
      him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could
      remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
      neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
      the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more
      continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on
      Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between
      Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she
      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
      himself&mdash;from whom she had previously received the information of his
      near concern in all his cousin&rsquo;s affairs, and whose character she had no
      reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
      him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
      at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
      have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
      cousin&rsquo;s corroboration.
    
    
      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
      between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s.
      Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now
      struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
      wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
      himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
      with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of
      seeing Mr. Darcy&mdash;that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he
      should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very
      next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had
      quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that
      after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no
      reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s character, though he had
      assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing
      the son.
    
    
      How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His
      attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
      hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
      the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His
      behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either
      been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his
      vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
      incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
      and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but
      allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his
      blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners,
      she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance&mdash;an
      acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her
      a sort of intimacy with his ways&mdash;seen anything that betrayed him to
      be unprincipled or unjust&mdash;anything that spoke him of irreligious or
      immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued&mdash;that
      even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often
      heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of
      some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham
      represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly
      have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person
      capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was
      incomprehensible.
    
    
      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could
      she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
    
    
      &ldquo;How despicably I have acted!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I, who have prided myself on my
      discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often
      disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in
      useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how
      just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more
      wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with
      the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the
      very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and
      ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this
      moment I never knew myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      From herself to Jane&mdash;from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a
      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s explanation
      there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
      different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
      credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
      give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
      sister&rsquo;s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte&rsquo;s
      opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
      description of Jane. She felt that Jane&rsquo;s feelings, though fervent, were
      little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and
      manner not often united with great sensibility.
    
    
      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of
      shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for
      denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having
      passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
      disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than
      on hers.
    
    
      The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but
      it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
      self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
      Jane&rsquo;s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations,
      and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such
      impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever
      known before.
    
    
      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety
      of thought&mdash;re-considering events, determining probabilities, and
      reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
      important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
      length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
      cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
      must make her unfit for conversation.
    
    
      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
      called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
      leave&mdash;but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at
      least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after
      her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just affect
      concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was
      no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 37
    
    
      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
      been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
      able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
      good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
      melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
      hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
      brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
      importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
      having them all to dine with her.
    
    
      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she
      chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future
      niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship&rsquo;s
      indignation would have been. &ldquo;What would she have said? how would she have
      behaved?&rdquo; were questions with which she amused herself.
    
    
      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. &ldquo;I assure
      you, I feel it exceedingly,&rdquo; said Lady Catherine; &ldquo;I believe no one feels
      the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to
      these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were
      excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied
      his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most
      acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings
      certainly increases.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were
      kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
    
    
      Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
      spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
      she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
    
    
      &ldquo;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you
      may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company,
      I am sure.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&rdquo; replied
      Elizabeth, &ldquo;but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next
      Saturday.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you
      to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be
      no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you
      for another fortnight.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
      are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another
      month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as
      London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does
      not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of
      you&mdash;and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should
      not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original
      plan.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. &ldquo;Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
      with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of
      two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You
      must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world
      to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and
      attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana
      went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two
      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of
      Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a
      different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must
      send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me
      to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let
      them go alone.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My uncle is to send a servant for us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have
      somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh!
      Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
      attended to.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
      and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which
      Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she
      might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for
      solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest
      relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might
      indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.
    
    
      Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
      studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times
      widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was
      still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had
      condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his
      disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment
      excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not
      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the
      slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour,
      there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy
      defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were
      hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would
      never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest
      daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was
      entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while
      they were supported by their mother&rsquo;s indulgence, what chance could there
      be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely
      under Lydia&rsquo;s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and
      Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They
      were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they
      would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn,
      they would be going there forever.
    
    
      Anxiety on Jane&rsquo;s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
      heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to
      have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could
      attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous
      then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect,
      so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been
      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
    
    
      When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham&rsquo;s
      character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
      seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
      almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
    
    
      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her
      stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and
      her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their
      journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so
      urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria
      thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the
      morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
    
    
      When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a
      good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and
      Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand
      to both.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 38
    
    
      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
      minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying
      the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
    
    
      &ldquo;I know not, Miss Elizabeth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether Mrs. Collins has yet
      expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
      certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
      The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how
      little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of
      living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the
      world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself;
      but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we
      have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
      unpleasantly.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
      spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
      Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her
      feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
      solemnity replied:
    
    
      &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
      disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having
      it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our
      connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home
      scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot
      have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which
      few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually
      we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the
      disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding
      in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at
      Rosings.&rdquo;
     
    
      Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
      obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
      and truth in a few short sentences.
    
    
      &ldquo;You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be
      able to do so. Lady Catherine&rsquo;s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have
      been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that
      your friend has drawn an unfortunate&mdash;but on this point it will be as
      well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I
      can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My
      dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is
      in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between
      us. We seem to have been designed for each other.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
      the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and
      rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the
      recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor
      Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had
      chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her
      visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and
      her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent
      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
    
    
      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
      placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
      parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.
      Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with
      his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the
      kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments
      to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria
      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly
      reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten
      to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
    
    
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you will of course wish to have your humble respects
      delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
      while you have been here.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the
      carriage drove off.
    
    
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Maria, after a few minutes&rsquo; silence, &ldquo;it seems but
      a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A great many indeed,&rdquo; said her companion with a sigh.
    
    
      &ldquo;We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
      How much I shall have to tell!&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth added privately, &ldquo;And how much I shall have to conceal!&rdquo;
     
    
      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
      within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s
      house, where they were to remain a few days.
    
    
      Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
      spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had
      reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn
      there would be leisure enough for observation.
    
    
      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
      Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s proposals. To know
      that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
      Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
      vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to
      openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in
      which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and
      her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 39
    
    
      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
      together from Gracechurch Street for the town of &mdash;&mdash;, in
      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s
      carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the
      coachman&rsquo;s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room
      up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
      employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard,
      and dressing a salad and cucumber.
    
    
      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out
      with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, &ldquo;Is not
      this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And we mean to treat you all,&rdquo; added Lydia, &ldquo;but you must lend us the
      money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.&rdquo; Then, showing
      her purchases&mdash;&ldquo;Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
      it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
      pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
      better.&rdquo;
     
    
      And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,
      &ldquo;Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have
      bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will
      be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this
      summer, after the &mdash;&mdash;shire have left Meryton, and they are
      going in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Are they indeed!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
    
    
      &ldquo;They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
      take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and
      I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too
      of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Elizabeth, &ldquo;that would be a delightful scheme
      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a
      whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one
      poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Now I have got some news for you,&rdquo; said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
      &ldquo;What do you think? It is excellent news&mdash;capital news&mdash;and
      about a certain person we all like!&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
      not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
      waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
      things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he
      is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my
      news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There
      is no danger of Wickham&rsquo;s marrying Mary King. There&rsquo;s for you! She is gone
      down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And Mary King is safe!&rdquo; added Elizabeth; &ldquo;safe from a connection
      imprudent as to fortune.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,&rdquo; said Jane.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never
      cared three straws about her&mdash;who could about such a nasty little
      freckled thing?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness
      of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was
      little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
    
    
      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered;
      and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes,
      work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty&rsquo;s and Lydia&rsquo;s
      purchases, were seated in it.
    
    
      &ldquo;How nicely we are all crammed in,&rdquo; cried Lydia. &ldquo;I am glad I bought my
      bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let
      us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And
      in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you
      went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I
      was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you
      came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost
      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married
      before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,
      you can&rsquo;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I
      do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like
      to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to
      all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at
      Colonel Forster&rsquo;s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.
      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.
      Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two
      Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by
      herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in
      woman&rsquo;s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a
      soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my
      aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot
      imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord!
      how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And
      that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out
      what was the matter.&rdquo;
     
    
      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
      assisted by Kitty&rsquo;s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions
      all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but
      there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham&rsquo;s name.
    
    
      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in
      undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say
      voluntarily to Elizabeth:
    
    
      &ldquo;I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.&rdquo;
     
    
      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came
      to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
      occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
      poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
      hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some
      way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
      Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person&rsquo;s, was
      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear
      her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! Mary,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
      As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was
      nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had
      not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
      handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon
      in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.
      And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have
      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so
      merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might
      have heard us ten miles off!&rdquo;
     
    
      To this Mary very gravely replied, &ldquo;Far be it from me, my dear sister, to
      depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
      generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me&mdash;I
      should infinitely prefer a book.&rdquo;
     
    
      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody
      for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
    
    
      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
      Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
      the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at
      home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was
      another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham
      again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her
      of the regiment&rsquo;s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a
      fortnight they were to go&mdash;and once gone, she hoped there could be
      nothing more to plague her on his account.
    
    
      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
      scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
      frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
      father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at
      the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
      disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 40
    
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
      longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular
      in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she
      related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy
      and herself.
    
    
      Miss Bennet&rsquo;s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
      partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
      natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
      sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
      little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
      unhappiness which her sister&rsquo;s refusal must have given him.
    
    
      &ldquo;His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and certainly
      ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
      disappointment!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
      other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You
      do not blame me, however, for refusing him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Blame you! Oh, no.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
      day.&rdquo;
     
    
      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
      as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
      who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so
      much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
      collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy&rsquo;s vindication, though grateful
      to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most
      earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to
      clear the one without involving the other.
    
    
      &ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;you never will be able to make both
      of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
      with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
      enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
      about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy&rsquo;s;
      but you shall do as you choose.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not know when I have been more shocked,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Wickham so very
      bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
      consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
      knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of
      his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
      of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing
      every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me
      saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light
      as a feather.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!
      such an openness and gentleness in his manner!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
      two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
      appearance of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as
      you used to do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to
      him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&rsquo;s genius, such an
      opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
      abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at
      a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the
      matter as you do now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
      with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
      that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!
      Oh! how I wanted you!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in
      speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly
      undeserved.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
      natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one
      point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or
      ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham&rsquo;s
      character.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, &ldquo;Surely there can be no
      occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
      make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative
      to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I
      endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will
      believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it
      would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place
      him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone;
      and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some
      time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their
      stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about
      it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
      ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
      re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.&rdquo;
     
    
      The tumult of Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
      got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
      and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to
      talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of
      which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half
      of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had
      been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
      partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
      last encumbrance of mystery. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if that very
      improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
      what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty
      of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!&rdquo;
     
    
      She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
      state of her sister&rsquo;s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
      very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in
      love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from
      her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments
      often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer
      him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to
      the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of
      those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
      tranquillity.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, Lizzy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet one day, &ldquo;what is your opinion now
      of this sad business of Jane&rsquo;s? For my part, I am determined never to
      speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
      But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
      a very undeserving young man&mdash;and I do not suppose there&rsquo;s the least
      chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
      coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
      everybody, too, who is likely to know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
      shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
      would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
      die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.&rdquo;
     
    
      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she
      made no answer.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, Lizzy,&rdquo; continued her mother, soon afterwards, &ldquo;and so the
      Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will
      last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent
      manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving
      enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare
      say.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, nothing at all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, they
      will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be
      distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose,
      they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look
      upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
      often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
      estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
      ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 41
    
    
      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the
      last of the regiment&rsquo;s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the
      neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The
      elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and
      pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they
      reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was
      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the
      family.
    
    
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?&rdquo; would they
      often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. &ldquo;How can you be smiling so,
      Lizzy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she
      had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I cried for two days together when Colonel
      Miller&rsquo;s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sure I shall break mine,&rdquo; said Lydia.
    
    
      &ldquo;If one could but go to Brighton!&rdquo; observed Mrs. Bennet.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
      disagreeable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,&rdquo;
       added Kitty.
    
    
      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
      Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of
      pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
      interference in the views of his friend.
    
    
      But the gloom of Lydia&rsquo;s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
      received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the
      regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very
      young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and
      good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their
      three months&rsquo; acquaintance they had been intimate two.
    
    
      The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the
      delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be
      described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&rsquo;s feelings, Lydia flew about
      the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone&rsquo;s congratulations, and
      laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless
      Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as
      unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
    
    
      &ldquo;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as
      much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years
      older.&rdquo;
     
    
      In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her
      resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
      exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
      considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for
      the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she
      could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She
      represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia&rsquo;s general behaviour, the
      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as
      Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with
      such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than
      at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
      place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
      expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you were aware,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;of the very great disadvantage to us
      all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&rsquo;s unguarded and
      imprudent manner&mdash;nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure
      you would judge differently in the affair.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Already arisen?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bennet. &ldquo;What, has she frightened away some
      of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish
      youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not
      worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been
      kept aloof by Lydia&rsquo;s folly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of
      particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
      importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild
      volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia&rsquo;s
      character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father,
      will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of
      teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her
      life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will
      be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever
      made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and
      meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a
      tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind,
      wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her
      rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is
      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle,
      and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it
      possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are
      known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately
      taking her hand said in reply:
    
    
      &ldquo;Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you
      must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage
      for having a couple of&mdash;or I may say, three&mdash;very silly sisters.
      We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let
      her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of
      any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to
      anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt
      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their
      notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own
      insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without
      authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.&rdquo;
     
    
      With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
      continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in
      her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She
      was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable
      evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
    
    
      Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
      father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
      united volubility. In Lydia&rsquo;s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
      every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of
      fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She
      saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
      present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp&mdash;its tents
      stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw
      herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
      officers at once.
    
    
      Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
      realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
      been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
      Lydia&rsquo;s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
      conviction of her husband&rsquo;s never intending to go there himself.
    
    
      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
      continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia&rsquo;s leaving
      home.
    
    
      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
      frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well
      over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt
      to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an
      affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour
      to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the
      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had
      marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what
      had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding
      herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry;
      and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof
      contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his
      attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her
      preference secured at any time by their renewal.
    
    
      On the very last day of the regiment&rsquo;s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
      with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
      disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry
      as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned
      Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s having both spent three weeks at
      Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
    
    
      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment&rsquo;s recollection
      and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and,
      after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she
      had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of
      indifference he soon afterwards added:
    
    
      &ldquo;How long did you say he was at Rosings?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nearly three weeks.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And you saw him frequently?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, almost every day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;His manners are very different from his cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. &ldquo;And
      pray, may I ask?&mdash;&rdquo; But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone,
      &ldquo;Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of
      civility to his ordinary style?&mdash;for I dare not hope,&rdquo; he continued
      in a lower and more serious tone, &ldquo;that he is improved in essentials.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;In essentials, I believe, he is very much what
      he ever was.&rdquo;
     
    
      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice
      over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her
      countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious
      attention, while she added:
    
    
      &ldquo;When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his
      mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing
      him better, his disposition was better understood.&rdquo;
     
    
      Wickham&rsquo;s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look;
      for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he
      turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:
    
    
      &ldquo;You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
      even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
      may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
      deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear
      that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
      is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
      judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I
      know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
      wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he
      has very much at heart.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
      slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
      the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
      him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his
      side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
      Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
      mutual desire of never meeting again.
    
    
      When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from
      whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between
      her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one
      who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was
      diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and
      impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of
      enjoying herself as much as possible&mdash;advice which there was every
      reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous
      happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of
      her sisters were uttered without being heard.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 42
    
    
      Had Elizabeth&rsquo;s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not
      have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
      comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
      of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman
      whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their
      marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and
      confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness
      were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort
      for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of
      those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or
      their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes
      had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little
      otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his
      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general
      wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are
      wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
    
    
      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
      father&rsquo;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
      respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
      herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
      banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and
      decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children,
      was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the
      disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage,
      nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a
      direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have
      preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of
      enlarging the mind of his wife.
    
    
      When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham&rsquo;s departure she found little
      other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
      abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
      sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them
      threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in
      time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain
      were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might
      be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance
      by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon
      the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before,
      that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not,
      in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It
      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement
      of actual felicity&mdash;to have some other point on which her wishes and
      hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation,
      console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.
      Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was
      her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the
      discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she
      have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been
      perfect.
    
    
      &ldquo;But it is fortunate,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;that I have something to wish for.
      Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
      But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
      sister&rsquo;s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
      pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never
      be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the
      defence of some little peculiar vexation.&rdquo;
     
    
      When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to
      her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
      always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
      they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had
      attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her
      quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would
      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent
      hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp;
      and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be
      learnt&mdash;for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too
      full of lines under the words to be made public.
    
    
      After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
      humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a
      happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back
      again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was
      restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June,
      Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;
      an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the
      following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention
      an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
      arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
      Meryton.
    
    
      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
      approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived
      from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed
      its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out
      till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a
      month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see
      so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and
      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and
      substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan,
      were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was
      enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.
      Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had
      formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a
      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the
      celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.
    
    
      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
      the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was
      her business to be satisfied&mdash;and certainly her temper to be happy;
      and all was soon right again.
    
    
      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
      impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
      owner. &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I may enter his county with impunity, and
      rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.&rdquo;
     
    
      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
      before her uncle and aunt&rsquo;s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
      Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
      Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
      younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
      Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness
      of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way&mdash;teaching
      them, playing with them, and loving them.
    
    
      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
      morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment
      was certain&mdash;that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which
      comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences&mdash;cheerfulness
      to enhance every pleasure&mdash;and affection and intelligence, which
      might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.
    
    
      It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor
      of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay;
      Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently
      known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the
      little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s former residence, and
      where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent
      their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country;
      and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that
      Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a
      mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before,
      Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr.
      Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her
      approbation.
    
    
      &ldquo;My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
      much?&rdquo; said her aunt; &ldquo;a place, too, with which so many of your
      acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
      know.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley,
      and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own
      that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she
      really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. &ldquo;If it were merely a fine house richly
      furnished,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I should not care about it myself; but the grounds
      are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth said no more&mdash;but her mind could not acquiesce. The
      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
      occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought
      it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.
      But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it
      could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the
      family were unfavourably answered.
    
    
      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether
      Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor?
      and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A
      most welcome negative followed the last question&mdash;and her alarms now
      being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see
      the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and
      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of
      indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To
      Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 43
    
    
      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
      Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in
      at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
    
    
      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
      entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a
      beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
    
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
      every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
      half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
      eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
      Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the
      road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building,
      standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;
      and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into
      greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither
      formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a
      place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so
      little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in
      their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of
      Pemberley might be something!
    
    
      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
      while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
      meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
      mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall;
      and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder
      at her being where she was.
    
    
      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine,
      and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her
      into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room,
      handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a
      window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had
      descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a
      beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked
      on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the
      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they
      passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but
      from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and
      handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor;
      but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy
      nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than
      the furniture of Rosings.
    
    
      &ldquo;And of this place,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;I might have been mistress! With these
      rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them
      as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to
      them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,&rdquo;&mdash;recollecting herself&mdash;&ldquo;that
      could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not
      have been allowed to invite them.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was a lucky recollection&mdash;it saved her from something very like
      regret.
    
    
      She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
      absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
      was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
      Reynolds replied that he was, adding, &ldquo;But we expect him to-morrow, with a
      large party of friends.&rdquo; How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey
      had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
    
    
      Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
      likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over
      the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The
      housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
      gentleman, the son of her late master&rsquo;s steward, who had been brought up
      by him at his own expense. &ldquo;He is now gone into the army,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but
      I am afraid he has turned out very wild.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
      return it.
    
    
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, &ldquo;is
      my master&mdash;and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
      other&mdash;about eight years ago.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have heard much of your master&rsquo;s fine person,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner,
      looking at the picture; &ldquo;it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
      us whether it is like or not.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation
      of her knowing her master.
    
    
      &ldquo;Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth coloured, and said: &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very handsome.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will
      see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
      master&rsquo;s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be
      then. He was very fond of them.&rdquo;
     
    
      This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s being among them.
    
    
      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
      when she was only eight years old.
    
    
      &ldquo;And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
      accomplished!&mdash;She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
      a new instrument just come down for her&mdash;a present from my master;
      she comes here to-morrow with him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
      communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by
      pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master
      and his sister.
    
    
      &ldquo;Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
      time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Except,&rdquo; thought Elizabeth, &ldquo;when she goes to Ramsgate.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If your master would marry, you might see more of him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who
      is good enough for him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, &ldquo;It is very
      much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,&rdquo;
       replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
      listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, &ldquo;I have
      never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
      since he was four years old.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
      ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
      Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
      grateful to her uncle for saying:
    
    
      &ldquo;There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
      having such a master.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not
      meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
      good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was
      always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth almost stared at her. &ldquo;Can this be Mr. Darcy?&rdquo; thought she.
    
    
      &ldquo;His father was an excellent man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him&mdash;just
      as affable to the poor.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
      Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of
      the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture,
      in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to
      which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led
      again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they
      proceeded together up the great staircase.
    
    
      &ldquo;He is the best landlord, and the best master,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that ever
      lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
      themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him
      a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
      anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
      like other young men.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In what an amiable light does this place him!&rdquo; thought Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;This fine account of him,&rdquo; whispered her aunt as they walked, &ldquo;is not
      quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps we might be deceived.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is not very likely; our authority was too good.&rdquo;
     
    
      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
      sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
      the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give
      pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at
      Pemberley.
    
    
      &ldquo;He is certainly a good brother,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
      one of the windows.
    
    
      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy&rsquo;s delight, when she should enter the
      room. &ldquo;And this is always the way with him,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Whatever can give
      his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing
      he would not do for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all
      that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but
      Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
      visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
      Darcy&rsquo;s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
      also more intelligible.
    
    
      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
      little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
      the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
      her&mdash;and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
      smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
      looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
      contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
      Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father&rsquo;s
      lifetime.
    
    
      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind, a more gentle
      sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
      their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was
      of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an
      intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered
      how many people&rsquo;s happiness were in his guardianship!&mdash;how much of
      pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!&mdash;how much of good or
      evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the
      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the
      canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she
      thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had
      ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its
      impropriety of expression.
    
    
      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
      they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
      consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
    
    
      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to
      look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
      conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
      suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
    
    
      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
      appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
      instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
      blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
      surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and
      spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of
      perfect civility.
    
    
      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received
      his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his
      first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been
      examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.
      Darcy, the gardener&rsquo;s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,
      must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was
      talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift
      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil
      inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since
      they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her
      embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there
      recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some
      of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;
      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he
      repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of
      her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as
      plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.
    
    
      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments
      without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
    
    
      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
      Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
      followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
      coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
      world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
      might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
      thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus
      come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner,
      they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was
      plain that he was that moment arrived&mdash;that moment alighted from his
      horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness
      of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered&mdash;what could
      it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!&mdash;but to speak
      with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she
      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such
      gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to
      his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!
      She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.
    
    
      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every
      step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the
      woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before
      Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically
      to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her
      eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the
      scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,
      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what
      at the moment was passing in his mind&mdash;in what manner he thought of
      her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.
      Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there
      had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had
      felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he
      certainly had not seen her with composure.
    
    
      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
      aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
    
    
      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
      ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
      the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
      valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
      many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
      of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With
      a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled
      the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them
      again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of
      the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple
      bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less
      adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted
      into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst
      the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its
      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their
      distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could
      go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as
      possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their
      way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest
      direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom
      able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water,
      and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst
      wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by
      the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The
      walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them
      to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least
      more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to
      speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few
      moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other
      path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their
      view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she
      saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
      politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but
      she had not got beyond the words &ldquo;delightful,&rdquo; and &ldquo;charming,&rdquo; when some
      unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley
      from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she
      said no more.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
      her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This
      was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could
      hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some
      of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to
      herself. &ldquo;What will be his surprise,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;when he knows who they
      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.&rdquo;
     
    
      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
      relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
      it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
      could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by
      the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
      so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
      conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could
      not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some
      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
      his taste, or his good manners.
    
    
      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite
      him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while
      he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him
      with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where
      there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm
      with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said
      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for
      herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she
      repeating, &ldquo;Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be
      for me&mdash;it cannot be for my sake that his manners are
      thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as
      this. It is impossible that he should still love me.&rdquo;
     
    
      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
      gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink
      of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there
      chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who,
      fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth&rsquo;s arm inadequate
      to her support, and consequently preferred her husband&rsquo;s. Mr. Darcy took
      her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short
      silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been
      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began
      by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected&mdash;&ldquo;for your
      housekeeper,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;informed us that you would certainly not be here
      till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that
      you were not immediately expected in the country.&rdquo; He acknowledged the
      truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned
      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he
      had been travelling. &ldquo;They will join me early to-morrow,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you&mdash;Mr.
      Bingley and his sisters.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
      driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s name had been the last
      mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his
      mind was not very differently engaged.
    
    
      &ldquo;There is also one other person in the party,&rdquo; he continued after a pause,
      &ldquo;who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do
      I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your
      stay at Lambton?&rdquo;
     
    
      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for
      her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that
      whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be
      the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
      satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
      him think really ill of her.
    
    
      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was
      not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
      His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest
      kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the
      carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.
    
    
      He then asked her to walk into the house&mdash;but she declared herself
      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
      have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
      there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
      that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
      with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly&mdash;and her
      patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
      over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s coming up they were all pressed to go
      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
      parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies
      into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly
      towards the house.
    
    
      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
      pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
      &ldquo;He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,&rdquo; said her uncle.
    
    
      &ldquo;There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,&rdquo; replied
      her aunt, &ldquo;but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
      say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
      have seen nothing of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than
      civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
      attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure, Lizzy,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;he is not so handsome as Wickham; or,
      rather, he has not Wickham&rsquo;s countenance, for his features are perfectly
      good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
      him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
      seen him so pleasant as this morning.
    
    
      &ldquo;But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,&rdquo; replied her
      uncle. &ldquo;Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at
      his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his
      grounds.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
      said nothing.
    
    
      &ldquo;From what we have seen of him,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Gardiner, &ldquo;I really should
      not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody
      as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the
      contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And
      there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one
      an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who
      showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly
      help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and
      that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
      his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
      guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
      relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
      construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
      Wickham&rsquo;s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
      confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
      transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her
      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
      approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the
      charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her
      husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything
      else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning&rsquo;s walk they had no sooner
      dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the
      evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many
      years&rsquo; discontinuance.
    
    
      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
      much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but
      think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s civility, and, above all, of
      his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 44
    
    
      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
      her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
      resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But
      her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at
      Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with
      some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress
      themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage
      drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle
      driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,
      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her
      relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her
      uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as
      she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the
      circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the
      business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there
      was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter
      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born
      notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own
      discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the
      partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and,
      more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every
      power of pleasing would fail her.
    
    
      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up
      and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
      inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
    
    
      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took
      place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was
      at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she
      had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a
      very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She
      found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.
    
    
      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
      little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
      womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
      was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
      unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute
      and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
      relieved by discerning such different feelings.
    
    
      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was
      also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
      satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley&rsquo;s quick step
      was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
      felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
      cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
      inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
      and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
    
    
      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than
      to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them,
      indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen
      of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with
      an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries
      the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of
      the lady&rsquo;s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the
      gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.
    
    
      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
      feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to
      make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared
      most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
      endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was
      ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
    
    
      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how
      ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like
      manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former
      occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he
      looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this
      might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss
      Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either
      side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that
      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon
      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted,
      which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not
      untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to
      the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the
      others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real
      regret, that it &ldquo;was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of
      seeing her;&rdquo; and, before she could reply, he added, &ldquo;It is above eight
      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all
      dancing together at Netherfield.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took
      occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all
      her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in
      the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them
      meaning.
    
    
      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,
      whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
      complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from
      hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the
      improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary
      its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him
      thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with
      whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace&mdash;when
      she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations
      whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in
      Hunsford Parsonage&mdash;the difference, the change was so great, and
      struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her
      astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear
      friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she
      seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending
      reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his
      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions
      were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both
      of Netherfield and Rosings.
    
    
      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to
      depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their
      wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at
      Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
      diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
      readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how
      she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
      acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
      that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
      any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
      society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
      her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
    
    
      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
      again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make
      after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into
      a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this
      account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left
      them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction,
      though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to
      be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she
      stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of
      Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
    
    
      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s curiosity; it was
      not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
      much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it
      was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
      interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
    
    
      Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as
      their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be
      untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their
      own feelings and his servant&rsquo;s report, without any reference to any other
      account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have
      recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in
      believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the
      authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and
      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily
      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their
      Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing
      to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would
      certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the
      family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal
      man, and did much good among the poor.
    
    
      With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
      there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
      son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
      fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him,
      which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
    
    
      As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
      the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
      long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion;
      and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
      certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had
      almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that
      could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable
      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased
      to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of
      a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and
      bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday
      had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive
      within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;
      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still
      well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in
      rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.
      He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,
      seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the
      acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any
      peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was
      soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known
      to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only
      astonishment but gratitude&mdash;for to love, ardent love, it must be
      attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be
      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly
      defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a
      real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she
      wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for
      the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy
      told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his
      addresses.
    
    
      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
      such a striking civility as Miss Darcy&rsquo;s in coming to see them on the very
      day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
      breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some
      exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be
      highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They
      were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked
      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
    
    
      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
      renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some
      of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 45
    
    
      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley&rsquo;s dislike of her had
      originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
      appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
      much civility on that lady&rsquo;s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
    
    
      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
      whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
      opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
      hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
      which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
    
    
      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with
      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.
      Georgiana&rsquo;s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the
      embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing
      wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief
      of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did
      her justice, and pitied her.
    
    
      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
      on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
      succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
      genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
      of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
      others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
      Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
      wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short
      sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
    
    
      Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
      and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
      calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from
      trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient
      distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.
      Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some
      of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the
      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or
      feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner
      a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley&rsquo;s voice, Elizabeth was
      roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her
      family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other
      said no more.
    
    
      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance
      of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits
      in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look
      and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her
      of her post. There was now employment for the whole party&mdash;for though
      they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of
      grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.
    
    
      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
      she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings
      which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment
      before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret
      that he came.
    
    
      He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
      gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only
      on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana
      that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be
      perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be
      made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the
      suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there
      was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came
      into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly
      marked as in Miss Bingley&rsquo;s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her
      face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet
      made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.
      Miss Darcy, on her brother&rsquo;s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk,
      and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get
      acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at
      conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in
      the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with
      sneering civility:
    
    
      &ldquo;Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the &mdash;&mdash;shire Militia removed from
      Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.&rdquo;
     
    
      In Darcy&rsquo;s presence she dared not mention Wickham&rsquo;s name; but Elizabeth
      instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
      various recollections connected with him gave her a moment&rsquo;s distress; but
      exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently
      answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an
      involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,
      earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and
      unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then
      giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the
      hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing
      forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her
      betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy&rsquo;s opinion, and,
      perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which
      some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had
      ever reached her of Miss Darcy&rsquo;s meditated elopement. To no creature had
      it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and
      from all Bingley&rsquo;s connections her brother was particularly anxious to
      conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to
      him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a
      plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate
      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his
      lively concern for the welfare of his friend.
    
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as
      Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
      Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to
      speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
      recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
      had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed
      them on her more and more cheerfully.
    
    
      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
      mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
      Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth&rsquo;s person,
      behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother&rsquo;s
      recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
      err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
      without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
      Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him
      some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
    
    
      &ldquo;How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; she cried;
      &ldquo;I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
      She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we
      should not have known her again.&rdquo;
     
    
      However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
      himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
      her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
      summer.
    
    
      &ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;I must confess that I never could see
      any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy;
      and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character&mdash;there
      is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of
      the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so
      fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp,
      shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there
      is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.&rdquo;
     
    
      Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
      the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
      wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
      success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
      determination of making him speak, she continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
      were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
      your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, &lsquo;She
      a beauty!&mdash;I should as soon call her mother a wit.&rsquo; But afterwards
      she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty
      at one time.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, &ldquo;but that
      was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
      considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.&rdquo;
     
    
      He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
      having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
      visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
      both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
      except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
      of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit&mdash;of everything but
      himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
      him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece&rsquo;s
      beginning the subject.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 46
    
    
      Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
      Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
      renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the
      third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of
      two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been
      missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written
      the direction remarkably ill.
    
    
      They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle
      and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The
      one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago.
      The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and
      engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half,
      which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more
      important intelligence. It was to this effect:
    
    
      &ldquo;Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most
      unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you&mdash;be
      assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An
      express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from
      Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one
      of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To
      Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very
      sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the
      best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and
      indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice
      over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,
      for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly
      grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let
      them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.
      They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not
      missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly.
      My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel
      Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines
      for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I
      cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to
      make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.&rdquo;
     
    
      Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what
      she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other,
      and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been
      written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
    
    
      &ldquo;By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
      wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
      head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
      Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and
      it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and
      our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken
      place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to
      Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
      before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia&rsquo;s short letter to
      Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green,
      something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never
      intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to
      Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to
      trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;
      for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and
      dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after
      this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what
      to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel
      F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the
      turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success&mdash;no
      such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he
      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most
      creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but
      no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very
      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill
      of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be
      married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he
      could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia&rsquo;s connections,
      which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!
      I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon
      their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he
      feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and
      keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is
      not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so
      affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but
      as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,
      dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing
      scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for
      your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told
      you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly
      begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and
      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still
      something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with
      Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I
      am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to
      pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is
      obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
      uncle&rsquo;s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
      immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! where, where is my uncle?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as
      she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
      moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened
      by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner
      made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in
      whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia&rsquo;s situation, hastily
      exclaimed, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr.
      Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an
      instant to lose.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Good God! what is the matter?&rdquo; cried he, with more feeling than
      politeness; then recollecting himself, &ldquo;I will not detain you a minute;
      but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not
      well enough; you cannot go yourself.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
      little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the
      servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
      accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress
      home instantly.
    
    
      On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
      looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
      or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, &ldquo;Let
      me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present
      relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. &ldquo;There is
      nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some
      dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.&rdquo;
     
    
      She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not
      speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something
      indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At
      length she spoke again. &ldquo;I have just had a letter from Jane, with such
      dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has
      left all her friends&mdash;has eloped; has thrown herself into the power
      of&mdash;of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You
      know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,
      nothing that can tempt him to&mdash;she is lost for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. &ldquo;When I consider,&rdquo; she added in a yet
      more agitated voice, &ldquo;that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he
      was. Had I but explained some part of it only&mdash;some part of what I
      learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
      have happened. But it is all&mdash;all too late now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am grieved indeed,&rdquo; cried Darcy; &ldquo;grieved&mdash;shocked. But is it
      certain&mdash;absolutely certain?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
      almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
      Scotland.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle&rsquo;s
      immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
      nothing can be done&mdash;I know very well that nothing can be done. How
      is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
      not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
    
    
      &ldquo;When my eyes were opened to his real character&mdash;Oh! had I
      known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not&mdash;I was afraid
      of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
      and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
      gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power
      was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family
      weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
      wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
      consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was,
      on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes;
      and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now,
      when all love must be vain.
    
    
      But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia&mdash;the
      humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
      every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth
      was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes,
      was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her
      companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke
      likewise restraint, said, &ldquo;I am afraid you have been long desiring my
      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real,
      though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either
      said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But
      I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask
      for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister&rsquo;s
      having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent
      business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as
      it is possible, I know it cannot be long.&rdquo;
     
    
      He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her
      distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason
      to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one
      serious, parting look, went away.
    
    
      As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
      should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked
      their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective
      glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and
      varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now
      have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its
      termination.
    
    
      If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
      otherwise&mdash;if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
      unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
      first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
      exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
      somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
      and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
      less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
      with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia&rsquo;s infamy must
      produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
      business. Never, since reading Jane&rsquo;s second letter, had she entertained a
      hope of Wickham&rsquo;s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
      could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of
      her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter
      remained in her mind, she was all surprise&mdash;all astonishment that
      Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for
      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
      as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
      Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of
      marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor
      her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
    
    
      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
      Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted
      only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer,
      sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them
      in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never
      without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards
      such a girl&mdash;oh! how acutely did she now feel it!
    
    
      She was wild to be at home&mdash;to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
      share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
      family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
      requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
      could be done for Lydia, her uncle&rsquo;s interference seemed of the utmost
      importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
      and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant&rsquo;s
      account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
      instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of
      the last with trembling energy.&mdash; Though Lydia had never been a favourite
      with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not
      Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations
      of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his
      power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of
      gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating
      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as
      possible. &ldquo;But what is to be done about Pemberley?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gardiner.
      &ldquo;John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That
      is all settled.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is all settled?&rdquo; repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
      prepare. &ldquo;And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
      truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!&rdquo;
     
    
      But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
      hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
      to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
      impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
      business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be
      written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
      sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
      Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained
      to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning,
      found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,
      seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 47
    
    
      &ldquo;I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,&rdquo; said her uncle, as they
      drove from the town; &ldquo;and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
      more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
      matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form
      such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,
      and who was actually staying in his colonel&rsquo;s family, that I am strongly
      inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step
      forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such
      an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the
      risk!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
    
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner, &ldquo;I begin to be of your uncle&rsquo;s
      opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
      interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.
      Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable
      of it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect
      I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not
      hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gardiner, &ldquo;there is no absolute proof
      that they are not gone to Scotland.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a
      presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
      Barnet road.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;supposing them to be in London. They may be there,
      though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It
      is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
      might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
      expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
      marriage be private? Oh, no, no&mdash;this is not likely. His most
      particular friend, you see by Jane&rsquo;s account, was persuaded of his never
      intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some
      money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia&mdash;what
      attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make
      him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying
      well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps
      might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge;
      for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as
      to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
      no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father&rsquo;s
      behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed
      to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do
      as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a
      matter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as
      to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, with
      tears in her eyes, &ldquo;that a sister&rsquo;s sense of decency and virtue in such a
      point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps
      I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been
      taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for
      a twelvemonth&mdash;she has been given up to nothing but amusement and
      vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and
      frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since
      the &mdash;&mdash;shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
      flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
      everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
      greater&mdash;what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which
      are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm
      of person and address that can captivate a woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you see that Jane,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;does not think so very ill of
      Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
      their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
      till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
      Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense
      of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false
      and deceitful as he is insinuating.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And do you really know all this?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as
      to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
    
    
      &ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, colouring. &ldquo;I told you, the other day,
      of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
      Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with
      such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
      circumstances which I am not at liberty&mdash;which it is not worth while
      to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
      what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
      reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must
      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and
      Jane seem so well to understand?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and
      saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
      ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the &mdash;&mdash;shire
      was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight&rsquo;s time. As that was the case,
      neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to
      make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any
      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should
      then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with
      Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never
      occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception
      never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue,
      you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
      suppose, to believe them fond of each other?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side;
      and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours
      is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered
      the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every
      girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two
      months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention;
      and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild
      admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who
      treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.&rdquo;
     
    
    
      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
      to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
      its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
      the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth&rsquo;s thoughts it was never absent.
      Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
      no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
    
    
      They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on
      the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort
      to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long
      expectations.
    
    
      The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on
      the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage
      drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and
      displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and
      frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
    
    
      Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried
      into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother&rsquo;s
      apartment, immediately met her.
    
    
      Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
      eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard
      of the fugitives.
    
    
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
      everything will be well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is my father in town?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And have you heard from him often?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
      that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
      particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
      again till he had something of importance to mention.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And my mother&mdash;how is she? How are you all?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
      shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
      all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
      Heaven, are quite well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;how are you?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;You look pale. How much you
      must have gone through!&rdquo;
     
    
      Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
      conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
      engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the
      whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them
      both, with alternate smiles and tears.
    
    
      When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had
      already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found
      that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however,
      which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she
      still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would
      bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their
      proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes&rsquo; 
      conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
      tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
      conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
      blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
      errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
    
    
      &ldquo;If I had been able,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to carry my point in going to Brighton,
      with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear
      Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go
      out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on
      their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had
      been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
      charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And
      now here&rsquo;s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
      wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of
      us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and
      if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.&rdquo;
     
    
      They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
      general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
      that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
      Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
    
    
      &ldquo;Do not give way to useless alarm,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;though it is right to be
      prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It
      is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may
      gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and
      have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As
      soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home
      with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what
      is to be done.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear brother,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;that is exactly what I could
      most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever
      they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.
      And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia
      she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are
      married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a
      dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits&mdash;and have
      such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me&mdash;such spasms in my
      side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no
      rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any
      directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know
      which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you
      will contrive it all.&rdquo;
     
    
      But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in
      the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her
      hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner
      was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the
      housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
    
    
      Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
      occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
      oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
      tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
      better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could
      most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.
    
    
      In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
      too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
      before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
      faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in
      either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which
      she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness
      than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough
      of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave
      reflection, soon after they were seated at table:
    
    
      &ldquo;This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
      But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
      each other the balm of sisterly consolation.&rdquo;
     
    
      Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
      &ldquo;Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
      lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false
      step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle
      than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her
      behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
      make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind
      of moral extractions from the evil before them.
    
    
      In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
      half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
      opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
      satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of
      this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet
      could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the
      subject, by saying, &ldquo;But tell me all and everything about it which I have
      not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster
      say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?
      They must have seen them together for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
      especially on Lydia&rsquo;s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
      grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was
      coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea
      of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got
      abroad, it hastened his journey.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
      their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of
      their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
      repeat his persuasion of their not marrying&mdash;and from that, I
      am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
      doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a
      little uneasy&mdash;a little fearful of my sister&rsquo;s happiness with him in
      marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.
      My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a
      match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing
      more than the rest of us, that in Lydia&rsquo;s last letter she had prepared her
      for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each
      other, many weeks.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But not before they went to Brighton?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I believe not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he
      know his real character?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
      did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
      affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
      but I hope this may be false.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this
      could not have happened!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would have been better,&rdquo; replied her sister. &ldquo;But to expose
      the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
      feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia&rsquo;s note to his
      wife?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He brought it with him for us to see.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
      were the contents:
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR HARRIET,
    
    
      &ldquo;You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing
      myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am
      going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you
      a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an
      angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.
      You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like
      it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and
      sign my name &lsquo;Lydia Wickham.&rsquo; What a good joke it will be! I can hardly
      write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my
      engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse
      me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball
      we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to
      Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my
      worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to
      Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.
    
    
      &ldquo;Your affectionate friend,
    
    
      &ldquo;LYDIA BENNET.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth when she had
      finished it. &ldquo;What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But
      at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their
      journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
      side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
      minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such
      confusion!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! Jane,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;was there a servant belonging to it who did
      not know the whole story before the end of the day?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very
      difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give
      her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I
      might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took
      from me my faculties.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well.
      Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon
      yourself alone.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
      fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty
      is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose
      should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday,
      after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with
      me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been
      very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and
      offered her services, or any of her daughters&rsquo;, if they should be of use
      to us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She had better have stayed at home,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;perhaps she meant
      well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of
      one&rsquo;s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let
      them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.&rdquo;
     
    
      She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
      intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
    
    
      &ldquo;He meant I believe,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;to go to Epsom, the place where they
      last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made
      out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the
      hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from
      London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady&rsquo;s
      removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make
      inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the
      coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries
      there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and
      number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had
      formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly
      discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 48
    
    
      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
      morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His
      family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
      dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
      They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send;
      but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
      Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
    
    
      When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
      information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to
      prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the
      great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security
      for her husband&rsquo;s not being killed in a duel.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days
      longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her
      nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great
      comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited
      them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and
      heartening them up&mdash;though, as she never came without reporting some
      fresh instance of Wickham&rsquo;s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went
      away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.
    
    
      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
      before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
      to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the
      title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman&rsquo;s family.
      Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
      everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance
      of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what
      was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister&rsquo;s
      ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became
      almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they
      had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of,
      they must in all probability have gained some news of them.
    
    
      Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
      letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
      found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
      that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
      without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
      determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
      thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
      coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did
      not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in
      it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed
      wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again
      very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:
    
    
      &ldquo;I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible,
      from some of the young man&rsquo;s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham
      has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part
      of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could
      apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of
      essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel
      Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this
      head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations
      he has now living, better than any other person.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
      authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
      of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
      heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of
      whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his
      companions in the &mdash;&mdash;shire might be able to give more
      information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
      application was a something to look forward to.
    
    
      Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part
      of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the
      grand object of every morning&rsquo;s impatience. Through letters, whatever of
      good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day
      was expected to bring some news of importance.
    
    
      But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their
      father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had
      received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she
      accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters
      always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR SIR,
    
    
      &ldquo;I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life,
      to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering
      under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.
      Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise
      with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which
      must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no
      time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can
      alleviate so severe a misfortune&mdash;or that may comfort you, under a
      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent&rsquo;s
      mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison
      of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
      suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of
      behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of
      indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and
      Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be
      naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early
      an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which
      opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady
      Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree
      with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be
      injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine
      herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
      And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented
      satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been
      otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let
      me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to
      throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her
      to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am, dear sir, etc., etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
      Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It
      was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up
      any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His
      former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the
      militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
      with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as
      likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
      finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his
      fear of discovery by Lydia&rsquo;s relations, for it had just transpired that he
      had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel
      Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to
      clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts
      of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to
      conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with
      horror. &ldquo;A gamester!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;This is wholly unexpected. I had not an
      idea of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
      father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
      spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
      his brother-in-law&rsquo;s entreaty that he would return to his family, and
      leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for
      continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not
      express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what
      her anxiety for his life had been before.
    
    
      &ldquo;What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Sure he
      will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
      and make him marry her, if he comes away?&rdquo;
     
    
      As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and
      the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came
      from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey,
      and brought its master back to Longbourn.
    
    
      Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
      Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
      name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
      the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
      being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
      received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
    
    
      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the
      lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly
      conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
      tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that,
      had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia&rsquo;s
      infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one
      sleepless night out of two.
    
    
      When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
      philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit
      of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it
      was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.
    
    
      It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
      Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
      expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, &ldquo;Say
      nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
      and I ought to feel it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You must not be too severe upon yourself,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
      fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been
      to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will
      pass away soon enough.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you suppose them to be in London?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And Lydia used to want to go to London,&rdquo; added Kitty.
    
    
      &ldquo;She is happy then,&rdquo; said her father drily; &ldquo;and her residence there will
      probably be of some duration.&rdquo;
     
    
      Then after a short silence he continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
      last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.&rdquo;
     
    
      They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother&rsquo;s tea.
    
    
      &ldquo;This is a parade,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;which does one good; it gives such an
      elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
      library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I
      can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not going to run away, papa,&rdquo; said Kitty fretfully. &ldquo;If I should
      ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
      for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you
      will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house
      again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
      prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
      never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten
      minutes of every day in a rational manner.&rdquo;
     
    
      Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
      girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
      them.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 49
    
    
      Two days after Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
      together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
      coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
      mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
      when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, &ldquo;I beg your pardon,
      madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
      good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear madam,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
      there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
      this half-hour, and master has had a letter.&rdquo;
     
    
      Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran
      through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library;
      their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up
      stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:
    
    
      &ldquo;If you are looking for my master, ma&rsquo;am, he is walking towards the little
      copse.&rdquo;
     
    
      Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
      and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing
      his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
    
    
      Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
      Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came
      up with him, and eagerly cried out:
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, what news&mdash;what news? Have you heard from my uncle?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes I have had a letter from him by express.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, and what news does it bring&mdash;good or bad?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is there of good to be expected?&rdquo; said he, taking the letter from
      his pocket. &ldquo;But perhaps you would like to read it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
    
    
      &ldquo;Read it aloud,&rdquo; said their father, &ldquo;for I hardly know myself what it is
      about.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR BROTHER,
    
    
      &ldquo;At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon
      the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on
      Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they
      were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they
      are discovered. I have seen them both&mdash;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Then it is as I always hoped,&rdquo; cried Jane; &ldquo;they are married!&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth read on:
    
    
      &ldquo;I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any
      intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements
      which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long
      before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your
      daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds
      secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister;
      and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
      life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,
      considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I
      thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no
      time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend,
      from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s circumstances are not so
      hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived
      in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,
      even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition
      to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full
      powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will
      immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
      settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to
      town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence
      and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to
      write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married
      from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day.
      I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours,
      etc.,
    
    
      &ldquo;EDW. GARDINER.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. &ldquo;Can it be
      possible that he will marry her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,&rdquo; said her sister.
      &ldquo;My dear father, I congratulate you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And have you answered the letter?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;No; but it must be done soon.&rdquo;
     
    
      Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
      wrote.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;come back and write immediately.
      Consider how important every moment is in such a case.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let me write for you,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;if you dislike the trouble yourself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dislike it very much,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but it must be done.&rdquo;
     
    
      And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
    
    
      &ldquo;And may I ask&mdash;&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;but the terms, I suppose, must be
      complied with.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
      are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your
      uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay
      him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Money! My uncle!&rdquo; cried Jane, &ldquo;what do you mean, sir?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
      temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
      gone.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;though it had not occurred to me
      before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it
      must be my uncle&rsquo;s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
      distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;Wickham&rsquo;s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
      less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
      in the very beginning of our relationship.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
      silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
      library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
    
    
      &ldquo;And they are really to be married!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were
      by themselves. &ldquo;How strange this is! And for this we are to be
      thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
      and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I comfort myself with thinking,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;that he certainly would
      not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle
      has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
      thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
      of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
      pounds?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If he were ever able to learn what Wickham&rsquo;s debts have been,&rdquo; said
      Elizabeth, &ldquo;and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
      exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not
      sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
      requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
      protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years
      of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with
      them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never
      deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,&rdquo; said
      Jane: &ldquo;I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry
      her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
      thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
      they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
      time make their past imprudence forgotten.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Their conduct has been such,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;as neither you, nor I,
      nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
      perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
      therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
      it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
      replied:
    
    
      &ldquo;Just as you please.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;May we take my uncle&rsquo;s letter to read to her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Take whatever you like, and get away.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
      together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
      would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
      the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
      soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s hope of Lydia&rsquo;s being soon married,
      her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
      She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been
      fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be
      married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor
      humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear, dear Lydia!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;This is delightful indeed! She will be
      married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good,
      kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything!
      How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the
      wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.
      Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give
      her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will
      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be
      together when we meet!&rdquo;
     
    
      Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
      these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
      Gardiner&rsquo;s behaviour laid them all under.
    
    
      &ldquo;For we must attribute this happy conclusion,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;in a great
      measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
      assist Mr. Wickham with money.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;it is all very right; who should do it but her
      own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must
      have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever
      had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a
      short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it
      sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a
      flutter, that I am sure I can&rsquo;t write; so I will dictate, and you write
      for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but
      the things should be ordered immediately.&rdquo;
     
    
      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
      cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
      not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
      father was at leisure to be consulted. One day&rsquo;s delay, she observed,
      would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so
      obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
    
    
      &ldquo;I will go to Meryton,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
      good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
      Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An
      airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
      anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
      heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all
      have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
      congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
      refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
    
    
      Poor Lydia&rsquo;s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
      worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking
      forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly
      expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two
      hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 50
    
    
      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
      instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the
      better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He
      now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia
      need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit
      could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of
      the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then
      have rested in its proper place.
    
    
      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
      should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was
      determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to
      discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
    
    
      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
      useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in
      cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and
      younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
      successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
      Bennet, for many years after Lydia&rsquo;s birth, had been certain that he
      would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late
      to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband&rsquo;s love
      of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.
    
    
      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
      the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
      latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
      regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
      could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms
      of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
      expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
      engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that,
      could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with
      so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would
      scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid
      them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual
      presents in money which passed to her through her mother&rsquo;s hands, Lydia&rsquo;s
      expenses had been very little within that sum.
    
    
      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
      another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
      little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of
      rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
      naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
      dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
      its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
      indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message
      to her.
    
    
      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
      speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
      philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
      conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest
      alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But
      there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured
      wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful
      old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of
      circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered
      certain.
    
    
      It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
      happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits
      oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The
      marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes
      since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her
      thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials,
      fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching
      through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,
      without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many
      as deficient in size and importance.
    
    
      &ldquo;Haye Park might do,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if the Gouldings could quit it&mdash;or
      the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
      too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
      Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants
      remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: &ldquo;Mrs. Bennet,
      before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let
      us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this
      neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
      impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.&rdquo;
     
    
      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon
      led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her
      husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He
      protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever
      on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger
      could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse
      his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem
      valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the
      disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter&rsquo;s
      nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with
      Wickham a fortnight before they took place.
    
    
      Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
      the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her
      sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
      termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable
      beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.
    
    
      She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few
      people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at
      the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister&rsquo;s frailty
      would have mortified her so much&mdash;not, however, from any fear of
      disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there
      seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia&rsquo;s marriage been concluded
      on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy
      would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would
      now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man
      whom he so justly scorned.
    
    
      From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish
      of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in
      Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.
      She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of
      what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to
      be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least
      chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been
      happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
    
    
      What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
      proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
      have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
      doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
      there must be a triumph.
    
    
      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
      disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
      temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was
      an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and
      liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and
      from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have
      received benefit of greater importance.
    
    
      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
      connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
      precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
      family.
    
    
      How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she
      could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a
      couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger
      than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
    
    
    
      Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s
      acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
      promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
      that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
      purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on
      quitting the militia.
    
    
      &ldquo;It was greatly my wish that he should do so,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as soon as his
      marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering
      the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and
      my niece&rsquo;s. It is Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s intention to go into the regulars; and
      among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to
      assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General
      &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage
      to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I
      hope among different people, where they may each have a character to
      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel
      Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he
      will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton,
      with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And
      will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his
      creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his
      information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not
      deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a
      week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to
      Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very
      desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and
      begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.&mdash;Yours, etc.,
    
    
      &ldquo;E. GARDINER.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham&rsquo;s removal
      from the &mdash;&mdash;shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.
      Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia&rsquo;s being settled in the
      North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
      for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
      Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
      pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
      with everybody, and had so many favourites.
    
    
      &ldquo;She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it will be quite shocking to
      send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes
      very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      regiment.&rdquo;
     
    
      His daughter&rsquo;s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted
      into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first
      an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for
      the sake of their sister&rsquo;s feelings and consequence, that she should be
      noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so
      rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as
      soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they
      thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of
      knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the
      neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote
      again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come;
      and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should
      proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham
      should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own
      inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her
      wishes.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 51
    
    
      Their sister&rsquo;s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
      probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
      them at &mdash;&mdash;, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.
      Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more
      especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself,
      had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her
      sister must endure.
    
    
      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
      them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
      the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
      anxious, uneasy.
    
    
      Lydia&rsquo;s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
      she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
      welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to
      Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity
      which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
    
    
      Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
      so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
      opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
      enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was
      shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
      fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
      congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
      round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed,
      with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.
    
    
      Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were
      always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly
      what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their
      relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before
      believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving
      within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent
      man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused
      their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
    
    
      There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of
      them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth,
      began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good
      humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They
      seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of
      the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects
      which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.
    
    
      &ldquo;Only think of its being three months,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;since I went away; it
      seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough
      happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no
      more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it
      would be very good fun if I was.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
      expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which
      she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, &ldquo;Oh! mamma, do the people
      hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we
      overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should
      know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my
      glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might
      see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
      and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the
      dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
      anxious parade, walk up to her mother&rsquo;s right hand, and hear her say to
      her eldest sister, &ldquo;Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
      lower, because I am a married woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
      from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits
      increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their
      other neighbours, and to hear herself called &ldquo;Mrs. Wickham&rdquo; by each of
      them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and
      boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, mamma,&rdquo; said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
      room, &ldquo;and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am
      sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good
      luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands.
      What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don&rsquo;t at
      all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, lord! yes;&mdash;there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall
      be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls,
      and I will take care to get good partners for them all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should like it beyond anything!&rdquo; said her mother.
    
    
      &ldquo;And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind
      you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is
      over.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I thank you for my share of the favour,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;but I do not
      particularly like your way of getting husbands.&rdquo;
     
    
      Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
      had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his
      regiment at the end of a fortnight.
    
    
      No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
      she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
      having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
      all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
      think, than such as did not.
    
    
      Wickham&rsquo;s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find
      it; not equal to Lydia&rsquo;s for him. She had scarcely needed her present
      observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their
      elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by
      his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he
      chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight
      was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the
      case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a
      companion.
    
    
      Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
      occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing
      best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first
      of September, than any body else in the country.
    
    
      One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
      elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
    
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You
      were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
      curious to hear how it was managed?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No really,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth; &ldquo;I think there cannot be too little said
      on the subject.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
      married, you know, at St. Clement&rsquo;s, because Wickham&rsquo;s lodgings were in
      that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
      o&rsquo;clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were
      to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a
      fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it
      off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt,
      all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was
      reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
      thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he
      would be married in his blue coat.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be
      over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were
      horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you&rsquo;ll believe me, I
      did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not
      one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but,
      however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage
      came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid
      man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is
      no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my
      uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be
      married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes&rsquo; time,
      and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had
      been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might
      have done as well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy!&rdquo; repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
      me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
      them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If it was to be secret,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;say not another word on the subject.
      You may depend upon my seeking no further.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; &ldquo;we will
      ask you no questions.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lydia, &ldquo;for if you did, I should certainly tell you all,
      and then Wickham would be angry.&rdquo;
     
    
      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
      power, by running away.
    
    
      But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
      was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
      sister&rsquo;s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where
      he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as
      to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was
      satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct
      in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such
      suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to
      her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were
      compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.
    
    
      &ldquo;You may readily comprehend,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;what my curiosity must be to
      know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking)
      a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.
      Pray write instantly, and let me understand it&mdash;unless it is, for
      very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think
      necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not that I shall, though,&rdquo; she added to herself, as she finished
      the letter; &ldquo;and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
      manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
      out.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane&rsquo;s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth
      privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;&mdash;till
      it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had
      rather be without a confidante.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 52
    
    
      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
      soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than,
      hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
      interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy;
      for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a
      denial.
    
    
      &ldquo;Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR NIECE,
    
    
      &ldquo;I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to
      answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise
      what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
      application; I did not expect it from you. Don&rsquo;t think me angry,
      however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
      inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to
      understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as
      I am&mdash;and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
      would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
      innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
    
    
      &ldquo;On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
      unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
      hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
      dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
      Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and
      that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia
      once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after
      ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The
      motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that
      Wickham&rsquo;s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it
      impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He
      generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he
      had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the
      world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his
      duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been
      brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would
      never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to
      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more
      than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for
      his resolving to follow us.
    
    
      &ldquo;There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess
      to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of
      disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in
      Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This
      Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went
      to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two
      or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not
      betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she
      really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone
      to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive
      them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At
      length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They
      were in &mdash;&mdash; street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on
      seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to
      persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his
      assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved
      on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted
      no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they
      should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.
      Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and
      expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham,
      he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself
      obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which
      were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of
      Lydia&rsquo;s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission
      immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very
      little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he
      knew he should have nothing to live on.
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
      Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do
      something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.
      But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the
      hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other
      country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
      against the temptation of immediate relief.
    
    
      &ldquo;They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
      course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
      reasonable.
    
    
      &ldquo;Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s next step was
      to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
      street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen,
      and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with
      him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to
      be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore
      readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He
      did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a
      gentleman had called on business.
    
    
      &ldquo;On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and,
      as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
    
    
      &ldquo;They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all
      settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
      Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
      obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
      accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true
      one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure
      (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it),
      your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
    
    
      &ldquo;They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the
      gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was
      forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
      was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which
      went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this
      morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
      would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was
      due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.
    
    
      &ldquo;You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.
      His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than
      a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her,
      and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by
      him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
      reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham&rsquo;s character had
      been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and
      noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I
      doubt whether his reserve, or anybody&rsquo;s reserve, can be
      answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear
      Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have
      yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the
      affair.
    
    
      &ldquo;When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were
      still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London
      once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
      receive the last finish.
    
    
      &ldquo;I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you
      tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford
      you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission
      to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in
      Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with
      her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane&rsquo;s
      letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh
      pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing
      to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness
      she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I
      am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I
      recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience
      with her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended
      the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
      Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I
      take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say
      before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect,
      been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and
      opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and
      that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I
      thought him very sly;&mdash;he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
      slyness seems the fashion.
    
    
      &ldquo;Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish
      me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
      have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of
      ponies, would be the very thing.
    
    
      &ldquo;But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
      hour.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yours, very sincerely,
    
    
      &ldquo;M. GARDINER.&rdquo;
     
    
      The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in
      which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
      greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
      produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister&rsquo;s
      match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
      great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
      pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
      He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
      trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
      supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
      despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
      persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid,
      and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all
      this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did
      whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by
      other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was
      insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her&mdash;for a
      woman who had already refused him&mdash;as able to overcome a sentiment so
      natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of
      Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to
      be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a
      reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of
      belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had
      liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would
      not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe
      that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause
      where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful,
      exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person
      who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her
      character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every
      ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had
      ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud
      of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able
      to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt&rsquo;s commendation of him
      again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
      sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
      steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
      confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
    
    
      She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one&rsquo;s approach;
      and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
      Wickham.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?&rdquo; said he,
      as he joined her.
    
    
      &ldquo;You certainly do,&rdquo; she replied with a smile; &ldquo;but it does not follow that
      the interruption must be unwelcome.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
      now we are better.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;True. Are the others coming out?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
      Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you
      have actually seen Pemberley.&rdquo;
     
    
      She replied in the affirmative.
    
    
      &ldquo;I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
      for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
      old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.
      But of course she did not mention my name to you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, she did.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had&mdash;not turned
      out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are
      strangely misrepresented.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced
      him; but he soon afterwards said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
      several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
      &ldquo;It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
      understood from the Gardiners that you had.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; he introduced us to his sister.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And do you like her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or
      two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you
      liked her. I hope she will turn out well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Did you go by the village of Kympton?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not recollect that we did.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most
      delightful place!&mdash;Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me
      in every respect.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How should you have liked making sermons?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the
      exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;&mdash;but,
      to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the
      retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!
      But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance,
      when you were in Kent?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was
      left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the
      first, you may remember.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
      so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
      declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had
      been compromised accordingly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what
      I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to
      get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister&rsquo;s sake, to provoke him, she
      only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
    
    
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
      quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.&rdquo;
     
    
      She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he
      hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 53
    
    
      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
      never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by
      introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had
      said enough to keep him quiet.
    
    
      The day of his and Lydia&rsquo;s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced
      to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into
      her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at
      least a twelvemonth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear Lydia,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;when shall we meet again?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, lord! I don&rsquo;t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Write to me very often, my dear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
      writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to
      do.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife&rsquo;s. He
      smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
    
    
      &ldquo;He is as fine a fellow,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the
      house, &ldquo;as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I
      am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to
      produce a more valuable son-in-law.&rdquo;
     
    
      The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
    
    
      &ldquo;I often think,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that there is nothing so bad as parting with
      one&rsquo;s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,&rdquo; said
      Elizabeth. &ldquo;It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
      single.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but
      only because her husband&rsquo;s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had
      been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.&rdquo;
     
    
      But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
      relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
      article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at
      Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master,
      who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
      Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and
      shook her head by turns.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,&rdquo; (for Mrs.
      Phillips first brought her the news). &ldquo;Well, so much the better. Not that
      I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I
      never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
      Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But
      that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
      mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You may depend on it,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;for Mrs. Nicholls was in
      Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
      to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
      comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
      going to the butcher&rsquo;s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
      Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
      colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth;
      but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
    
    
      &ldquo;I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
      report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don&rsquo;t imagine it was from
      any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I
      should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
      me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
      alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself,
      but I dread other people&rsquo;s remarks.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
      Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
      other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
      to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there
      with his friend&rsquo;s permission, or being bold enough to come without
      it.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yet it is hard,&rdquo; she sometimes thought, &ldquo;that this poor man cannot come
      to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
      speculation! I will leave him to himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
      feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
      perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
      more unequal, than she had often seen them.
    
    
      The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
      about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
    
    
      &ldquo;As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;you will
      wait on him of course.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
      went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
      nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool&rsquo;s errand again.&rdquo;
     
    
      His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
      would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
      Netherfield.
    
    
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an etiquette I despise,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If he wants our society, let him
      seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running
      after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
      on him. But, however, that shan&rsquo;t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am
      determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make
      thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband&rsquo;s
      incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours
      might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.
      As the day of his arrival drew near,&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,&rdquo; said Jane to her sister. &ldquo;It
      would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
      hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
      but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
      says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish I could say anything to comfort you,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth; &ldquo;but it
      is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of
      preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so
      much.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
      contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
      and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the
      days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless
      of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in
      Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the
      paddock and ride towards the house.
    
    
      Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
      kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to
      the window&mdash;she looked,&mdash;she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat
      down again by her sister.
    
    
      &ldquo;There is a gentleman with him, mamma,&rdquo; said Kitty; &ldquo;who can it be?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; replied Kitty, &ldquo;it looks just like that man that used to be with him
      before. Mr. what&rsquo;s-his-name. That tall, proud man.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!&mdash;and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend
      of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
      say that I hate the very sight of him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of
      their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which
      must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after
      receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.
      Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother
      talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to
      him only as Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s friend, without being heard by either of them.
      But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by
      Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s
      letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he
      could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she
      had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the
      person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits,
      and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at
      least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her
      astonishment at his coming&mdash;at his coming to Netherfield, to
      Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she
      had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
    
    
      The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute
      with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes,
      as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must
      still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
    
    
      &ldquo;Let me first see how he behaves,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it will then be early enough
      for expectation.&rdquo;
     
    
      She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
      lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
      sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler
      than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
      tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
      symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
    
    
      Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
      again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
      had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
      she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
      she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother&rsquo;s
      presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
      not an improbable, conjecture.
    
    
      Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
      saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
      Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
      especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her
      curtsey and address to his friend.
    
    
      Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
      preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt
      and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.
    
    
      Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
      which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
      was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it
      had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he
      could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the
      sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of
      curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking
      at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More
      thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were
      plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being
      so.
    
    
      &ldquo;Could I expect it to be otherwise!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Yet why did he come?&rdquo;
     
    
      She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him
      she had hardly courage to speak.
    
    
      She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet.
    
    
      He readily agreed to it.
    
    
      &ldquo;I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did
      say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I
      hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the
      neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And
      one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must
      have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
      though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, &lsquo;Lately,
      George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,&rsquo; without there being a syllable
      said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my
      brother Gardiner&rsquo;s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such
      an awkward business of it. Did you see it?&rdquo;
     
    
      Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared
      not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,&rdquo;
       continued her mother, &ldquo;but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard
      to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
      place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know
      how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his
      leaving the &mdash;&mdash;shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
      Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he
      deserves.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
      of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,
      the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
      before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
      country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
    
    
      &ldquo;When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; said her mother,
      &ldquo;I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s
      manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all
      the best of the covies for you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
      flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
      hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that
      years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of
      such painful confusion.
    
    
      &ldquo;The first wish of my heart,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;is never more to be in
      company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that
      will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or
      the other again!&rdquo;
     
    
      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how
      much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former
      lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every
      five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her
      as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,
      though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be
      perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much
      as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know
      when she was silent.
    
    
      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
      intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn
      in a few days time.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;for when you
      went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as
      soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was
      very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
      engagement.&rdquo;
     
    
      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
      his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there
      that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think
      anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she
      had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had
      ten thousand a year.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 54
    
    
      As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or
      in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must
      deaden them more. Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s behaviour astonished and vexed her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;did he come at all?&rdquo;
     
    
      She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
    
    
      &ldquo;He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he
      was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no
      longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no
      more about him.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of
      her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better
      satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.
      I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his
      coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen
      that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very indifferent indeed,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, laughingly. &ldquo;Oh, Jane,
      take care.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
      you as ever.&rdquo;
     
    
    
      They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the
      meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour
      and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour&rsquo;s visit, had revived.
    
    
      On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who
      were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
      sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room,
      Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place,
      which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.
      Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to
      sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane
      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed
      himself by her.
    
    
      Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore
      it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had
      received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise
      turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
    
    
      His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
      admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
      Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane&rsquo;s happiness, and his own,
      would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
      consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
      gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no
      cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could
      divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a
      situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
      advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she
      could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was
      their manner whenever they did. Her mother&rsquo;s ungraciousness, made the
      sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind; and she
      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his
      kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
    
    
      She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
      bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
      without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
      the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
      uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen
      came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She
      looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of
      pleasure for the evening must depend.
    
    
      &ldquo;If he does not come to me, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall give him up
      for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered
      her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss
      Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a
      confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit
      of a chair. And on the gentlemen&rsquo;s approaching, one of the girls moved
      closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:
    
    
      &ldquo;The men shan&rsquo;t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
      do we?&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
      her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
      to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being
      so silly!
    
    
      &ldquo;A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
      expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
      protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
      There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!&rdquo;
     
    
      She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
      himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
    
    
      &ldquo;Is your sister at Pemberley still?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
      these three weeks.&rdquo;
     
    
      She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with
      her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some
      minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady&rsquo;s whispering to
      Elizabeth again, he walked away.
    
    
      When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
      all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all
      her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother&rsquo;s
      rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the
      rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were
      confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,
      but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to
      make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper;
      but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she
      had no opportunity of detaining them.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well girls,&rdquo; said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, &ldquo;What say
      you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I
      assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison
      was roasted to a turn&mdash;and everybody said they never saw so fat a
      haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases&rsquo; 
      last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were
      remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at
      least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.
      Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you
      think she said besides? &lsquo;Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield
      at last.&rsquo; She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as
      ever lived&mdash;and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at
      all handsome: I like them prodigiously.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
      Bingley&rsquo;s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
      last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
      humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not
      seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
    
    
      &ldquo;It has been a very agreeable day,&rdquo; said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. &ldquo;The
      party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
      may often meet again.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth smiled.
    
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
      assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
      agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
      perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any
      design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
      greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing,
      than any other man.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are very cruel,&rdquo; said her sister, &ldquo;you will not let me smile, and are
      provoking me to it every moment.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How hard it is in some cases to be believed!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And how impossible in others!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
      acknowledge?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
      instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me;
      and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 55
    
    
      A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
      friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten
      days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good
      spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
      expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
    
    
      &ldquo;Next time you call,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I hope we shall be more lucky.&rdquo;
     
    
      He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
      give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
    
    
      &ldquo;Can you come to-morrow?&rdquo;
     
    
      Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
      accepted with alacrity.
    
    
      He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
      dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter&rsquo;s room, in her dressing gown,
      and with her hair half finished, crying out:
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come&mdash;Mr. Bingley is
      come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
      Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy&rsquo;s
      hair.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We will be down as soon as we can,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;but I dare say Kitty is
      forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
      Where is your sash, my dear?&rdquo;
     
    
      But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
      without one of her sisters.
    
    
      The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
      evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom,
      and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being
      thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and
      Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.
      Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very
      innocently said, &ldquo;What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me
      for? What am I to do?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.&rdquo; She then sat still five
      minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly
      got up, and saying to Kitty, &ldquo;Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,&rdquo;
       took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which
      spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she
      would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the
      door and called out:
    
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was forced to go.
    
    
      &ldquo;We may as well leave them by themselves you know;&rdquo; said her mother, as
      soon as she was in the hall. &ldquo;Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my
      dressing-room.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly
      in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the
      drawing-room.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
      thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
      ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
      evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
      mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of
      countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
    
    
      He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away,
      an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s means,
      for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
    
    
      After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
      between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the
      happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
      returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
      persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman&rsquo;s
      concurrence.
    
    
      Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
      morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
      agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or
      folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
      silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other
      had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in
      the evening Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s invention was again at work to get every body
      away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went
      into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others
      were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract
      her mother&rsquo;s schemes.
    
    
      But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
      saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
      had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
      sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
      earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both,
      as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have
      told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she
      thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well
      as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to
      her sister, ran out of the room.
    
    
      Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
      pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
      emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
    
    
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis too much!&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why
      is not everybody as happy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
      delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness
      was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself
      to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the
      present.
    
    
      &ldquo;I must go instantly to my mother;&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I would not on any account
      trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from
      anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know
      that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
      how shall I bear so much happiness!&rdquo;
     
    
      She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card
      party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
    
    
      Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
      with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
      previous months of suspense and vexation.
    
    
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is the end of all his friend&rsquo;s anxious
      circumspection! of all his sister&rsquo;s falsehood and contrivance! the
      happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!&rdquo;
     
    
      In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
      father had been short and to the purpose.
    
    
      &ldquo;Where is your sister?&rdquo; said he hastily, as he opened the door.
    
    
      &ldquo;With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.&rdquo;
     
    
      He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
      affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
      delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great
      cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all
      he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane&rsquo;s perfections; and in
      spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations
      of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the
      excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a
      general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.
    
    
      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
      Miss Bennet&rsquo;s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
      made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
      her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak
      her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she
      talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet
      joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really
      happy he was.
    
    
      Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor
      took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his
      daughter, and said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are a good girl;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I have great pleasure in thinking
      you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well
      together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so
      complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every
      servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your
      income.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
      unpardonable in me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; cried his wife, &ldquo;what are you
      talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
      more.&rdquo; Then addressing her daughter, &ldquo;Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
      happy! I am sure I shan&rsquo;t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
      would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
      be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
      he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
      that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
      ever was seen!&rdquo;
     
    
      Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
      favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
      sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
      which she might in future be able to dispense.
    
    
      Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
      begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
    
    
      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
      coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
      supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
      detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
      obliged to accept.
    
    
      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
      while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but
      she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of
      separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
      attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and
      when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
    
    
      &ldquo;He has made me so happy,&rdquo; said she, one evening, &ldquo;by telling me that he
      was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
      it possible.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I suspected as much,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth. &ldquo;But how did he account for it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It must have been his sister&rsquo;s doing. They were certainly no friends to
      his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
      chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as
      I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to
      be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be
      what we once were to each other.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is the most unforgiving speech,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;that I ever heard
      you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe
      of Miss Bingley&rsquo;s pretended regard.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he
      really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being
      indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
      modesty.&rdquo;
     
    
      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the
      little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to
      find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though
      Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it
      was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!&rdquo; cried
      Jane. &ldquo;Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above
      them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but
      such another man for you!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.
      Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
      happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
      good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.&rdquo;
     
    
      The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
      secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she
      ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in
      Meryton.
    
    
      The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
      world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they
      had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 56
    
    
      One morning, about a week after Bingley&rsquo;s engagement with Jane had been
      formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
      dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
      sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
      lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
      equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
      were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
      preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
      the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
      shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
      continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open
      and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
    
    
      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment
      was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty,
      though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth
      felt.
    
    
      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
      other reply to Elizabeth&rsquo;s salutation than a slight inclination of the
      head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name
      to her mother on her ladyship&rsquo;s entrance, though no request of
      introduction had been made.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
      high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
      for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
    
    
      &ldquo;And that I suppose is one of your sisters.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. &ldquo;She
      is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my
      eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I
      believe, will soon become a part of the family.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have a very small park here,&rdquo; returned Lady Catherine after a short
      silence.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure
      you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer;
      the windows are full west.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
      added:
    
    
      &ldquo;May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
      Mrs. Collins well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
      Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
      letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
    
    
      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
      refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
      declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
      on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
      will favour me with your company.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Go, my dear,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;and show her ladyship about the
      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended
      her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady
      Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and
      pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked
      on.
    
    
      Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
      that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
      conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
      disagreeable.
    
    
      &ldquo;How could I ever think her like her nephew?&rdquo; said she, as she looked in
      her face.
    
    
      As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
      manner:&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
      journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
      come.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
    
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
      for the honour of seeing you here.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet,&rdquo; replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, &ldquo;you ought to know,
      that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may
      choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been
      celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment
      as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming
      nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was
      on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss
      Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to
      my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a
      scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose
      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this
      place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you believed it impossible to be true,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, colouring with
      astonishment and disdain, &ldquo;I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
      What could your ladyship propose by it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,&rdquo; said Elizabeth
      coolly, &ldquo;will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is
      in existence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report
      is spread abroad?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I never heard that it was.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
      ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
      he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
      But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made
      him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have
      drawn him in.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
      language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
      and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
      ever induce me to be explicit.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
      engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
      make an offer to me.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
    
    
      &ldquo;The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
      they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his
      mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union:
      and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
      accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
      inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the
      family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit
      engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety
      and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he
      was destined for his cousin?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
      other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept
      from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de
      Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its
      completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor
      inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?
      And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss
      Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
      friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be
      censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your
      alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any
      of us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;These are heavy misfortunes,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth. &ldquo;But the wife of Mr.
      Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
      attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
      to repine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
      for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score?
      Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with
      the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded
      from it. I have not been used to submit to any person&rsquo;s whims. I have not
      been in the habit of brooking disappointment.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That will make your ladyship&rsquo;s situation at present more pitiable;
      but it will have no effect on me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew
      are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from
      the same noble line; and, on the father&rsquo;s, from respectable, honourable,
      and ancient&mdash;though untitled&mdash;families. Their fortune on both
      sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every
      member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart
      pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is
      this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of
      your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have
      been brought up.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
      sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter; so far we are
      equal.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;True. You are a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter. But who was your mother? Who
      are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Whatever my connections may be,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;if your nephew does not
      object to them, they can be nothing to you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?&rdquo;
     
    
      Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
      Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
      moment&rsquo;s deliberation:
    
    
      &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
    
    
      &ldquo;And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I will make no promise of the kind.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
      reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
      will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance
      I require.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated
      into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to
      marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
      their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me,
      would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his
      cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you
      have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as
      the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
      you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
      nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
      but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no
      stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister&rsquo;s infamous elopement.
      I know it all; that the young man&rsquo;s marrying her was a patched-up
      business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to
      be my nephew&rsquo;s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father&rsquo;s
      steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!&mdash;of what are you
      thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You can now have nothing further to say,&rdquo; she resentfully answered. &ldquo;You
      have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the
      house.&rdquo;
     
    
      And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.
      Her ladyship was highly incensed.
    
    
      &ldquo;You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
      Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
      must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are then resolved to have him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
      which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference
      to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims
      of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the
      opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;have any
      possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
      would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
      resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
      were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment&rsquo;s
      concern&mdash;and the world in general would have too much sense to join
      in the scorn.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
      shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition
      will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable;
      but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.&rdquo;
     
    
      In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the
      carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, &ldquo;I take no leave of you,
      Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such
      attention. I am most seriously displeased.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship
      to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the
      carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met
      her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not
      come in again and rest herself.
    
    
      &ldquo;She did not choose it,&rdquo; said her daughter, &ldquo;she would go.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
      civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
      She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton,
      thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing
      particular to say to you, Lizzy?&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 57
    
    
      The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth
      into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn
      to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had
      actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole
      purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a
      rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement
      could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected
      that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being
      the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one
      wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not
      herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them
      more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore
      (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she
      concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost
      certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some
      future time.
    
    
      In revolving Lady Catherine&rsquo;s expressions, however, she could not help
      feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
      in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent
      their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an
      application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
      representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
      not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
      aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
      that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and
      it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one,
      whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
      address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
      probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and
      ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
    
    
      If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
      seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle
      every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
      unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
      Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
      Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
    
    
      &ldquo;If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
      friend within a few days,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I shall know how to understand it.
      I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If
      he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my
      affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.&rdquo;
     
    
    
      The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
      been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind
      of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s curiosity; and Elizabeth
      was spared from much teasing on the subject.
    
    
      The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father,
      who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
    
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was going to look for you; come into my room.&rdquo;
     
    
      She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
      her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
      connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be
      from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent
      explanations.
    
    
      She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then
      said,
    
    
      &ldquo;I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.
      As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did
      not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let
      me congratulate you on a very important conquest.&rdquo;
     
    
      The colour now rushed into Elizabeth&rsquo;s cheeks in the instantaneous
      conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and
      she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself
      at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself;
      when her father continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
      as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover
      the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
      which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
      Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
      on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: &lsquo;Having thus
      offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this
      happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of
      which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
      Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
      her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
      be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
      this land.&rsquo; 
    
    
      &ldquo;Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? &lsquo;This young
      gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
      mortal can most desire,&mdash;splendid property, noble kindred, and
      extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my
      cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
      precipitate closure with this gentleman&rsquo;s proposals, which, of course, you
      will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.&rsquo; 
    
    
      &ldquo;Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:
    
    
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
      that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a
      friendly eye.&rsquo; 
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have
      surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
      the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
      effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman
      but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It
      is admirable!&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth tried to join in her father&rsquo;s pleasantry, but could only force
      one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
      little agreeable to her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Are you not diverted?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. Pray read on.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
      night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
      felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
      family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
      consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to
      give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her
      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily
      into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.&rsquo; Mr. Collins
      moreover adds, &lsquo;I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia&rsquo;s sad business
      has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living
      together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I
      must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from
      declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into
      your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice;
      and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have
      opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never
      to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your
      hearing.&rsquo; That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his
      letter is only about his dear Charlotte&rsquo;s situation, and his expectation
      of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.
      You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be
      affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for
      our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any
      other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference,
      and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I
      abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins&rsquo;s correspondence for
      any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
      him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
      hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
      about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?&rdquo;
     
    
      To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
      been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
      repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings
      appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would
      rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he
      said of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at
      such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing
      too little, she might have fancied too much.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 58
    
    
      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
      Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with
      him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine&rsquo;s visit.
      The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him
      of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary
      dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all
      walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of
      walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off
      together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip
      them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to
      entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much
      afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate
      resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
    
    
      They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria;
      and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when
      Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for
      her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she
      immediately said:
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
      relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
      can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
      sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
      acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of
      my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,&rdquo; replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and
      emotion, &ldquo;that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken
      light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so
      little to be trusted.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You must not blame my aunt. Lydia&rsquo;s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me
      that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not
      rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the
      name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to
      take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of
      discovering them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you will thank me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;let it be for yourself alone.
      That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
      inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family
      owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her
      companion added, &ldquo;You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings
      are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My
      affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me
      on this subject for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his
      situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very
      fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so
      material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her
      receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness
      which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;
      and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a
      man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to
      encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of
      heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she
      could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in
      proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment
      more valuable.
    
    
      They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
      be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
      soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
      to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
      London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
      substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
      every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship&rsquo;s apprehension,
      peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such
      a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her
      nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its
      effect had been exactly contrariwise.
    
    
      &ldquo;It taught me to hope,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to
      hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you
      been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
      acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, &ldquo;Yes, you know enough of my
      frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so
      abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
      your relations.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
      accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to
      you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I
      cannot think of it without abhorrence.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
      evening,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
      will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in
      civility.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
      then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
      it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
      reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: &lsquo;had you behaved in a more
      gentlemanlike manner.&rsquo; Those were your words. You know not, you can
      scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;&mdash;though it was some
      time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
      impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a
      way.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
      feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
      forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
      way that would induce you to accept me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
      all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Darcy mentioned his letter. &ldquo;Did it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did it soon make you think
      better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?&rdquo;
     
    
      She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
      former prejudices had been removed.
    
    
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
      necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
      especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power
      of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make
      you hate me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
      preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
      opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
      changed as that implies.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;When I wrote that letter,&rdquo; replied Darcy, &ldquo;I believed myself perfectly
      calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful
      bitterness of spirit.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
      adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of
      the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely
      different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
      attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy.
      Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
      arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
      innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
      which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being
      all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught
      what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given
      good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
      Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by
      my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that
      was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be
      selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to
      think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think
      meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from
      eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you,
      dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a
      lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was
      properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You
      showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
      worthy of being pleased.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
      wishing, expecting my addresses.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.
      I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
      How you must have hated me after that evening?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a
      proper direction.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
      Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by
      you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness,
      and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My object then,&rdquo; replied Darcy, &ldquo;was to show you, by every civility in my
      power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain
      your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your
      reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced
      themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I
      had seen you.&rdquo;
     
    
      He then told her of Georgiana&rsquo;s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
      disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the
      cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
      following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
      before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
      had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
      comprehend.
    
    
      She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
      each, to be dwelt on farther.
    
    
      After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
      anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it
      was time to be at home.
    
    
      &ldquo;What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!&rdquo; was a wonder which introduced
      the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their
      engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
    
    
      &ldquo;I must ask whether you were surprised?&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.&rdquo; And
      though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
      the case.
    
    
      &ldquo;On the evening before my going to London,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I made a confession
      to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all
      that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and
      impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest
      suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in
      supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as
      I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no
      doubt of their happiness together.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
      friend.
    
    
      &ldquo;Did you speak from your own observation,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when you told him
      that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which
      I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
      him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented
      his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance
      on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which
      for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to
      conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I
      had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger,
      I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your
      sister&rsquo;s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
      friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
      herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it
      was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,
      which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
      conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 59
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?&rdquo; was a question which
      Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from
      all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply,
      that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She
      coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a
      suspicion of the truth.
    
    
      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
      acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
      Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and
      Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy
      than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate
      embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what
      would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware
      that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it
      was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
    
    
      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from
      Miss Bennet&rsquo;s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!&mdash;engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,
      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I
      am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in
      earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
      engaged.&rdquo;
     
    
      Jane looked at her doubtingly. &ldquo;Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
      you dislike him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps
      I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,
      a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember
      it myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
      seriously assured her of its truth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,&rdquo; cried
      Jane. &ldquo;My dear, dear Lizzy, I would&mdash;I do congratulate you&mdash;but
      are you certain? forgive the question&mdash;are you quite certain that you
      can be happy with him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we
      are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?
      Shall you like to have such a brother?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
      delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
      really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
      marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
      to do?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when
      I tell you all.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid
      you will be angry.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously.
      Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
      how long you have loved him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But
      I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at
      Pemberley.&rdquo;
     
    
      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired
      effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
      attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
      further to wish.
    
    
      &ldquo;Now I am quite happy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for you will be as happy as myself. I
      always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
      must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley&rsquo;s friend and your
      husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
      Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
      tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of
      it to another, not to you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
      mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her
      equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal
      from her his share in Lydia&rsquo;s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the
      night spent in conversation.
    
    
    
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
      morning, &ldquo;if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our
      dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming
      here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other,
      and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you
      must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was
      really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.
    
    
      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook
      hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he
      soon afterwards said aloud, &ldquo;Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
      hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;to walk to
      Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never
      seen the view.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It may do very well for the others,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bingley; &ldquo;but I am sure
      it will be too much for Kitty. Won&rsquo;t it, Kitty?&rdquo; Kitty owned that she had
      rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view
      from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to
      get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
    
    
      &ldquo;I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
      all for Jane&rsquo;s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
      him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.&rdquo;
     
    
      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s consent should be
      asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
      application for her mother&rsquo;s. She could not determine how her mother would
      take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be
      enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were
      violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was
      certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her
      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first
      raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.
    
    
    
      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.
      Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
      extreme. She did not fear her father&rsquo;s opposition, but he was going to be
      made unhappy; and that it should be through her means&mdash;that she,
      his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
      filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her&mdash;was a
      wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again,
      when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few
      minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and,
      while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, &ldquo;Go to your father,
      he wants you in the library.&rdquo; She was gone directly.
    
    
      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. &ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting
      this man? Have not you always hated him?&rdquo;
     
    
      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
      reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
      explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but
      they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her
      attachment to Mr. Darcy.
    
    
      &ldquo;Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
      sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But
      will they make you happy?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Have you any other objection,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;than your belief of my
      indifference?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
      this would be nothing if you really liked him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do, I do like him,&rdquo; she replied, with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;I love him.
      Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know
      what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such
      terms.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I have given him my consent. He is the kind of
      man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
      condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on
      having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
      disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
      respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up
      to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest
      danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and
      misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to
      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
      at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of
      her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him
      had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not
      the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months&rsquo; suspense, and
      enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her
      father&rsquo;s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said he, when she ceased speaking, &ldquo;I have no more to
      say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
      you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.&rdquo;
     
    
      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
      had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
    
    
      &ldquo;This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
      made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow&rsquo;s debts, and got him
      his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and
      economy. Had it been your uncle&rsquo;s doing, I must and would have paid
      him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I
      shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love
      for you, and there will be an end of the matter.&rdquo;
     
    
      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
      Mr. Collins&rsquo;s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at
      last to go&mdash;saying, as she quitted the room, &ldquo;If any young men come
      for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.&rdquo;
     
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
      half an hour&rsquo;s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the
      others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety,
      but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything
      material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come
      in time.
    
    
      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
      and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
      for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter
      a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend
      what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the
      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of
      them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get
      up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
    
    
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
      have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
      and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you
      will have! Jane&rsquo;s is nothing to it&mdash;nothing at all. I am so pleased&mdash;so
      happy. Such a charming man!&mdash;so handsome! so tall!&mdash;Oh, my dear
      Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he
      will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is
      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What
      will become of me. I shall go distracted.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
      Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon
      went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her
      mother followed her.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dearest child,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand
      a year, and very likely more! &lsquo;Tis as good as a Lord! And a special
      licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my
      dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I
      may have it to-morrow.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was a sad omen of what her mother&rsquo;s behaviour to the gentleman
      himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
      possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations&rsquo; consent,
      there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much
      better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her
      intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was
      in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his
      opinion.
    
    
      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
      acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
      every hour in his esteem.
    
    
      &ldquo;I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wickham, perhaps, is
      my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well
      as Jane&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 60
    
    
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy
      to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. &ldquo;How could you
      begin?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had
      once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
      laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew
      that I had begun.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners&mdash;my
      behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and
      I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now
      be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;For the liveliness of your mind, I did.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
      The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
      attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and
      looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and
      interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been
      really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains
      you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just;
      and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
      courted you. There&mdash;I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
      it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
      reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me&mdash;but nobody
      thinks of that when they fall in love.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
      ill at Netherfield?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
      by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to
      exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to
      find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be;
      and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to
      come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
      called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
      you look as if you did not care about me?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I was embarrassed.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And so was I.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A man who had felt less, might.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I
      should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would
      have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would
      have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for
      your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am
      afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a
      breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This
      will never do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
      Catherine&rsquo;s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
      removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your
      eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait
      for any opening of yours. My aunt&rsquo;s intelligence had given me hope, and I
      was determined at once to know every thing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
      for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
      Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or
      had you intended any more serious consequence?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether
      I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
      myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and
      if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
      befall her?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought
      to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
      directly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire
      the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have
      an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.&rdquo;
     
    
      From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had
      been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s long
      letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be
      most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had
      already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:
    
    
      &ldquo;I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
      for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
      truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
      But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
      fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject
      will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot
      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal
      more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not
      going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of
      the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the
      happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before,
      but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only
      smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can
      spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
      different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to
      his last.
    
    
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,
    
    
      &ldquo;I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be
      the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if
      I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yours sincerely, etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bingley&rsquo;s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to
      Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
      professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
      though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
      kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
    
    
      The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
      as sincere as her brother&rsquo;s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
      insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
      being loved by her sister.
    
    
      Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to
      Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses
      were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was
      soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the
      contents of her nephew&rsquo;s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the
      match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a
      moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth,
      though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the
      pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading
      and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with
      admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he
      complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and
      expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James&rsquo;s, with
      very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir
      William was out of sight.
    
    
      Mrs. Phillips&rsquo;s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
      forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too
      much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley&rsquo;s good humour
      encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor
      was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to
      make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the
      frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself,
      and to those of her family with whom he might converse without
      mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this
      took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the
      hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when
      they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all
      the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      Chapter 61
    
    
      Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
      rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
      afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.
      I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of
      her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children
      produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
      well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky
      for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so
      unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably
      silly.
    
    
      Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
      drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
      going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
    
    
      Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a
      vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his
      easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
      sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
      to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
      of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
    
    
      Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
      her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
      known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper
      as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia&rsquo;s example, she became,
      by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and
      less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia&rsquo;s society she was of
      course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to
      come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her
      father would never consent to her going.
    
    
      Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
      drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s being quite
      unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she
      could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer
      mortified by comparisons between her sisters&rsquo; beauty and her own, it was
      suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much
      reluctance.
    
    
      As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the
      marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
      Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and
      falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was
      not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his
      fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on
      her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by
      himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:
    
    
      &ldquo;MY DEAR LIZZY,
    
    
      &ldquo;I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
      Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
      rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I
      am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think
      we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place
      would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak
      to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     
    
      As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured
      in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
      Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of
      what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently
      sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as
      theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants,
      and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support;
      and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure
      of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their
      bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace
      dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always
      moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always
      spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into
      indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and
      her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage
      had given her.
    
    
      Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
      occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
      in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
      staid so long, that even Bingley&rsquo;s good humour was overcome, and he
      proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
    
    
      Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy&rsquo;s marriage; but as she
      thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
      dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
      attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to
      Elizabeth.
    
    
      Pemberley was now Georgiana&rsquo;s home; and the attachment of the sisters was
      exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other
      even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the
      world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
      astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking
      to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which
      almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.
      Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take
      liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a
      sister more than ten years younger than himself.
    
    
      Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and
      as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply
      to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so
      very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse
      was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth&rsquo;s persuasion, he was prevailed
      on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little
      further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way,
      either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife
      conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in
      spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the
      presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the
      city.
    
    
      With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as
      well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of
      the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into
      Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

      CHAPTER I
    
    
      About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven
      thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of
      Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to
      the rank of a baronet&rsquo;s lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an
      handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness
      of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at
      least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it. She had
      two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their
      acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as
      Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal
      advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the
      world as there are pretty women to deserve them. Miss Ward, at the end of
      half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr.
      Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any private fortune,
      and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward&rsquo;s match, indeed, when it came
      to the point, was not contemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give
      his friend an income in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris
      began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a
      thousand a year. But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to
      disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without
      education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could
      hardly have made a more untoward choice. Sir Thomas Bertram had interest,
      which, from principle as well as pride&mdash;from a general wish of doing
      right, and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in
      situations of respectability, he would have been glad to exert for the
      advantage of Lady Bertram&rsquo;s sister; but her husband&rsquo;s profession was such
      as no interest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other
      method of assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken
      place. It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such as
      a very imprudent marriage almost always produces. To save herself from
      useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject
      till actually married. Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil
      feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would have contented
      herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking no more of the
      matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be
      satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point
      out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill
      consequences. Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an
      answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed
      such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs.
      Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse
      between them for a considerable period.
    
    
      Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so
      distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other&rsquo;s
      existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to make it very
      wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power
      to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry voice, that Fanny had
      got another child. By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could
      no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one connexion
      that might possibly assist her. A large and still increasing family, an
      husband disabled for active service, but not the less equal to company and
      good liquor, and a very small income to supply their wants, made her eager
      to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed
      Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,
      such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else,
      as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was preparing
      for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and
      imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she could
      not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance
      of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten years old, a
      fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world; but what could
      she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas
      in the concerns of his West Indian property? No situation would be beneath
      him; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent
      out to the East?
    
    
      The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness. Sir
      Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched money
      and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.
    
    
      Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more important
      advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was often observing
      to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of
      her head, and that, much as they had all done for her, she seemed to be
      wanting to do more; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish
      that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one
      child entirely out of her great number. &ldquo;What if they were among them to
      undertake the care of her eldest daughter, a girl now nine years old, of
      an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give?
      The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the
      benevolence of the action.&rdquo; Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly. &ldquo;I
      think we cannot do better,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;let us send for the child.&rdquo;
     
    
      Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. He
      debated and hesitated;&mdash;it was a serious charge;&mdash;a girl so
      brought up must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty
      instead of kindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own
      four children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;&mdash;but no
      sooner had he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris
      interrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
      generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a piece
      with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to
      the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a
      child one had in a manner taken into one&rsquo;s own hands; and I am sure I
      should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an
      occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little
      matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?&mdash;and
      I am sure Mr. Norris is too just&mdash;but you know I am a woman of few
      words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a
      trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the
      world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without
      farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at
      least of yours, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without
      many advantages. I don&rsquo;t say she would be so handsome as her cousins. I
      dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of
      this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human
      probability, would get her a creditable establishment. You are thinking of
      your sons&mdash;but do not you know that, of all things upon earth, that
      is the least likely to happen, brought up as they would be, always
      together like brothers and sisters? It is morally impossible. I never knew
      an instance of it. It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against
      the connexion. Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for
      the first time seven years hence, and I dare say there would be mischief.
      The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us
      all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear,
      sweet-tempered boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this
      time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will
      never be more to either than a sister.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is a great deal of truth in what you say,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas, &ldquo;and
      far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan
      which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each. I only
      meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and that to
      make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to ourselves, we
      must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her
      hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman, if
      no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I thoroughly understand you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;you are everything that
      is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree on this
      point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready enough to do
      for the good of those I love; and, though I could never feel for this
      little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear
      children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate
      myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a sister&rsquo;s child?
      and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her?
      My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I
      am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous
      thing. So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister
      tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, I
      will engage to get the child to Mansfield; you shall have no
      trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never regard. I will send
      Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed at her cousin the
      saddler&rsquo;s, and the child be appointed to meet her there. They may easily
      get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care of any
      creditable person that may chance to be going. I dare say there is always
      some reputable tradesman&rsquo;s wife or other going up.&rdquo;
     
    
      Except to the attack on Nanny&rsquo;s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any
      objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous being
      accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled, and the
      pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The division of
      gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have been equal;
      for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of
      the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being
      at any expense whatever in her maintenance. As far as walking, talking,
      and contriving reached, she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew
      better how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money was
      equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as well how to save her
      own as to spend that of her friends. Having married on a narrower income
      than she had been used to look forward to, she had, from the first,
      fancied a very strict line of economy necessary; and what was begun as a
      matter of prudence, soon grew into a matter of choice, as an object of
      that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply. Had there
      been a family to provide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her
      money; but having no care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her
      frugality, or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income
      which they had never lived up to. Under this infatuating principle,
      counteracted by no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for
      her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so
      expensive a charity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to
      walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief
      of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.
    
    
      When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully
      explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s calm inquiry of &ldquo;Where shall
      the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?&rdquo; Sir Thomas heard with
      some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s power to take
      any share in the personal charge of her. He had been considering her as a
      particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable companion
      to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found himself wholly
      mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl&rsquo;s staying with
      them, at least as things then were, was quite out of the question. Poor
      Mr. Norris&rsquo;s indifferent state of health made it an impossibility: he
      could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly; if, indeed, he
      should ever get well of his gouty complaints, it would be a different
      matter: she should then be glad to take her turn, and think nothing of the
      inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her
      time, and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract
      him.
    
    
      &ldquo;Then she had better come to us,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, with the utmost
      composure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, &ldquo;Yes, let
      her home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and
      she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and
      of a regular instructress.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;which are both very important
      considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has
      three girls to teach, or only two&mdash;there can be no difference. I only
      wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not
      one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her,
      however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away
      for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little
      white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best place for
      her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the
      housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and take
      care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect
      Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I do not see that you
      could possibly place her anywhere else.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Bertram made no opposition.
    
    
      &ldquo;I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;and
      be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Should her disposition be really bad,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, &ldquo;we must not, for
      our own children&rsquo;s sake, continue her in the family; but there is no
      reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish
      altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some
      meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but these
      are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for her
      associates. Had my daughters been younger than herself, I should
      have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very
      serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for them,
      and everything to hope for her, from the association.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I think,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;and what I was saying
      to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the child, said I,
      only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would
      learn to be good and clever from them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I hope she will not tease my poor pug,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;I have but
      just got Julia to leave it alone.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,&rdquo; observed Sir
      Thomas, &ldquo;as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they
      grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the
      consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of
      their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make her
      remember that she is not a Miss Bertram. I should wish to see them
      very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the
      smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot
      be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will always be
      different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must assist us in our
      endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed with
      him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that
      between them it would be easily managed.
    
    
      It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister
      in vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed
      on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most
      thankfully, assuring them of her daughter&rsquo;s being a very well-disposed,
      good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw her
      off. She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was
      sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.
      Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of
      her children.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II
    
    
      The little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at Northampton
      was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost
      to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others, and
      recommending her to their kindness.
    
    
      Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might
      not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,
      nothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no glow
      of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,
      and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar,
      her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. Sir
      Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir Thomas, seeing
      how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that was conciliating:
      but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment; and Lady
      Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or speaking one word where
      he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured smile, became immediately
      the less awful character of the two.
    
    
      The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the
      introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at
      least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall of
      their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin.
      The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of
      their father, who addressed them on the occasion with rather an
      injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to company and
      praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their confidence
      increasing from their cousin&rsquo;s total want of it, they were soon able to
      take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference.
    
    
      They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the
      daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of
      their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in
      person, as education had given to their address; and no one would have
      supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There were in
      fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia Bertram was only
      twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor meanwhile was as
      unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing
      for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up, and could scarcely
      speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs. Norris had been talking to her
      the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the
      extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to
      produce, and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the
      idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy. The fatigue,
      too, of so long a journey, became soon no trifling evil. In vain were the
      well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas, and all the officious
      prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl; in vain did
      Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug, and
      vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort;
      she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and
      sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her
      sorrows in bed.
    
    
      &ldquo;This is not a very promising beginning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny had
      left the room. &ldquo;After all that I said to her as we came along, I thought
      she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend upon her
      acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a little
      sulkiness of temper&mdash;her poor mother had a good deal; but we must
      make allowances for such a child&mdash;and I do not know that her being
      sorry to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults,
      it was her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has
      changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.&rdquo;
     
    
      It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to
      allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the
      separation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were very
      acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody meant
      to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her
      comfort.
    
    
      The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to
      afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their young
      cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap on
      finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and
      when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so
      good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous present of
      some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself, while they
      adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment,
      making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.
    
    
      Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the
      drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something to
      fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by Lady Bertram&rsquo;s
      silence, awed by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s grave looks, and quite overcome by Mrs.
      Norris&rsquo;s admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on
      her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss Lee wondered at
      her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her clothes; and when to
      these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom
      she had always been important as playfellow, instructress, and nurse, the
      despondence that sunk her little heart was severe.
    
    
      The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. The rooms
      were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched she
      expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of something or
      other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry; and the little
      girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it at night as
      seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune, ended every
      day&rsquo;s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week had passed in this way,
      and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner, when she was
      found one morning by her cousin Edmund, the youngest of the sons, sitting
      crying on the attic stairs.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear little cousin,&rdquo; said he, with all the gentleness of an excellent
      nature, &ldquo;what can be the matter?&rdquo; And sitting down by her, he was at great
      pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and persuade her to
      speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry with her? or had she
      quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled about anything in her
      lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short, want anything he could
      possibly get her, or do for her? For a long while no answer could be
      obtained beyond a &ldquo;no, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;no, thank you&rdquo;; but he
      still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home,
      than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay. He tried
      to console her.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which shows
      you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are with
      relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you happy. Let
      us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your brothers and
      sisters.&rdquo;
     
    
      On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and
      sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her
      thoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, and wanted
      most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her constant
      companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom he was the
      darling) in every distress. &ldquo;William did not like she should come away; he
      had told her he should miss her very much indeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;But William will write
      to you, I dare say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he had promised he would, but he had told her
      to write first.&rdquo; &ldquo;And when shall you do it?&rdquo; She hung her head and
      answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;she did not know; she had not any paper.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and every
      other material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Would
      it make you happy to write to William?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall
      find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, cousin, will it go to the post?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and, as
      your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My uncle!&rdquo; repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to
      frank.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and
      they went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her
      paper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could
      himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He continued
      with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with his penknife or
      his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to these attentions,
      which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which delighted her
      beyond all the rest. He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin
      William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal. Fanny&rsquo;s feelings on
      the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing;
      but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their
      gratitude and delight, and her cousin began to find her an interesting
      object. He talked to her more, and, from all that she said, was convinced
      of her having an affectionate heart, and a strong desire of doing right;
      and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great
      sensibility of her situation, and great timidity. He had never knowingly
      given her pain, but he now felt that she required more positive kindness;
      and with that view endeavoured, in the first place, to lessen her fears of
      them all, and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to
      playing with Maria and Julia, and being as merry as possible.
    
    
      From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a friend,
      and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with
      everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less
      formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease
      to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the best
      manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and awkwardnesses
      which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all, and
      not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longer
      materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt Norris&rsquo;s
      voice make her start very much. To her cousins she became occasionally an
      acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and
      strength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes were
      sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially when that
      third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not but own,
      when their aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmund urged
      her claims to their kindness, that &ldquo;Fanny was good-natured enough.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure on
      the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen
      will always think fair with a child of ten. He was just entering into
      life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest
      son, who feels born only for expense and enjoyment. His kindness to his
      little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights: he made her
      some very pretty presents, and laughed at her.
    
    
      As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought
      with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was pretty soon
      decided between them that, though far from clever, she showed a tractable
      disposition, and seemed likely to give them little trouble. A mean opinion
      of her abilities was not confined to them. Fanny could read, work,
      and write, but she had been taught nothing more; and as her cousins found
      her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar, they
      thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first two or three weeks were
      continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing-room. &ldquo;Dear
      mama, only think, my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together&mdash;or
      my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia&mdash;or, she never
      heard of Asia Minor&mdash;or she does not know the difference between
      water-colours and crayons!&mdash;How strange!&mdash;Did you ever hear
      anything so stupid?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; their considerate aunt would reply, &ldquo;it is very bad, but you
      must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as
      yourself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!&mdash;Do you know, we asked
      her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, she
      should cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle of
      Wight, and she calls it the Island, as if there were no
      other island in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself,
      if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot
      remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the
      least notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the
      chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their
      accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the other; &ldquo;and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;
      besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,
      semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful memories,
      and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a vast deal of
      difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and therefore you
      must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency. And remember
      that, if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves, you should always
      be modest; for, much as you know already, there is a great deal more for
      you to learn.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another
      thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not
      want to learn either music or drawing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great want
      of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know whether
      it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing to me)
      your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you, it is not at
      all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;&mdash;on the
      contrary, it is much more desirable that there should be a difference.&rdquo;
     
    
      Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces&rsquo; 
      minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promising talents
      and early information, they should be entirely deficient in the less
      common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. In
      everything but disposition they were admirably taught. Sir Thomas did not
      know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he was not
      outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed all the
      flow of their spirits before him.
    
    
      To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest
      attention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spent her
      days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of
      needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than her
      children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to
      inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas, and in
      smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater leisure for the
      service of her girls, she would probably have supposed it unnecessary, for
      they were under the care of a governess, with proper masters, and could
      want nothing more. As for Fanny&rsquo;s being stupid at learning, &ldquo;she could
      only say it was very unlucky, but some people were stupid, and
      Fanny must take more pains: she did not know what else was to be done;
      and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor
      little thing, and always found her very handy and quick in carrying
      messages, and fetching what she wanted.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at
      Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her
      attachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her
      cousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though
      Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too lowly
      of her own claims to feel injured by it.
    
    
      From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in
      consequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave up
      the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring, and
      remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in
      Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise
      from her absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss Bertrams continued
      to exercise their memories, practise their duets, and grow tall and
      womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person, manner, and
      accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his anxiety. His eldest son
      was careless and extravagant, and had already given him much uneasiness;
      but his other children promised him nothing but good. His daughters, he
      felt, while they retained the name of Bertram, must be giving it new
      grace, and in quitting it, he trusted, would extend its respectable
      alliances; and the character of Edmund, his strong good sense and
      uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, and happiness to
      himself and all his connexions. He was to be a clergyman.
    
    
      Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested, Sir
      Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price:
      he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as
      they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny, though almost
      totally separated from her family, was sensible of the truest satisfaction
      in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of anything at all promising
      in their situation or conduct. Once, and once only, in the course of many
      years, had she the happiness of being with William. Of the rest she saw
      nothing: nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again, even
      for a visit, nobody at home seemed to want her; but William determining,
      soon after her removal, to be a sailor, was invited to spend a week with
      his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea. Their eager
      affection in meeting, their exquisite delight in being together, their
      hours of happy mirth, and moments of serious conference, may be imagined;
      as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last, and
      the misery of the girl when he left her. Luckily the visit happened in the
      Christmas holidays, when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin
      Edmund; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do,
      and be hereafter, in consequence of his profession, as made her gradually
      admit that the separation might have some use. Edmund&rsquo;s friendship never
      failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind
      dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving
      them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or any fear of
      doing too much, he was always true to her interests, and considerate of
      her feelings, trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer
      the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her
      advice, consolation, and encouragement.
    
    
      Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could not bring
      her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance
      in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending its pleasures. He
      knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense,
      and a fondness for reading, which, properly directed, must be an education
      in itself. Miss Lee taught her French, and heard her read the daily
      portion of history; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure
      hours, he encouraged her taste, and corrected her judgment: he made
      reading useful by talking to her of what she read, and heightened its
      attraction by judicious praise. In return for such services she loved him
      better than anybody in the world except William: her heart was divided
      between the two.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III
    
    
      The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.
      Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily
      introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the
      Parsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house of
      Sir Thomas&rsquo;s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her
      husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and for
      her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.
    
    
      The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few years
      sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were
      old enough for orders. But Tom&rsquo;s extravagance had, previous to that event,
      been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation
      necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of
      the elder. There was another family living actually held for Edmund; but
      though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s conscience, he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice,
      and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction,
      in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been
      able to say or do.
    
    
      &ldquo;I blush for you, Tom,&rdquo; said he, in his most dignified manner; &ldquo;I blush
      for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your
      feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,
      twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income which
      ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I hope it
      will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be forgotten that
      no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us,
      and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for the certain advantage
      which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts.&rdquo;
     
    
      Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly as
      possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he
      had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends; secondly, that
      his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and, thirdly,
      that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in all probability,
      die very soon.
    
    
      On Mr. Norris&rsquo;s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,
      who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a
      hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram&rsquo;s
      calculations. But &ldquo;no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,
      and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.&rdquo;
     
    
      He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and they
      entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very
      respectable, agreeable people.
    
    
      The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to claim
      her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s situation, and the
      improvement in Fanny&rsquo;s age, seeming not merely to do away any former
      objection to their living together, but even to give it the most decided
      eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than
      heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate, in addition to
      his eldest son&rsquo;s extravagance, it became not undesirable to himself to be
      relieved from the expense of her support, and the obligation of her future
      provision. In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be, he
      mentioned its probability to his wife; and the first time of the subject&rsquo;s
      occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present, she calmly
      observed to her, &ldquo;So, Fanny, you are going to leave us, and live with my
      sister. How shall you like it?&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt&rsquo;s words,
      &ldquo;Going to leave you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years with
      us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died. But you
      must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.&rdquo;
     
    
      The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She had
      never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love her.
    
    
      &ldquo;I shall be very sorry to go away,&rdquo; said she, with a faltering voice.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say you will; that&rsquo;s natural enough. I suppose you
      have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any
      creature in the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,&rdquo; said Fanny modestly.
    
    
      &ldquo;No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And am I never to live here again?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make very
      little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the
      difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt
      with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told
      him her distress.
    
    
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;something is going to happen which I do not like at
      all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to
      things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am
      going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to
      leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as she
      is removed there.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call it
      an excellent one.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, cousin!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible
      woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactly
      where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere. You
      will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you very
      much, Fanny?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in it:
      I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the same
      with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to children.
      But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving
      better already; and when you are her only companion, you must be
      important to her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I can never be important to any one.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is to prevent you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you
      never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly. There
      is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are
      known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a
      grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to
      return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and
      companion.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; said Fanny, colouring at such praise; &ldquo;how shall I ever
      thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I am to
      go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as
      the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off
      instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as much
      as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the year. The only
      difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will necessarily be
      brought forward as you ought to be. Here there are too many whom
      you can hide behind; but with her you will be forced to speak for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! I do not say so.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better
      fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of a temper
      to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about, and she
      will force you to do justice to your natural powers.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny sighed, and said, &ldquo;I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to
      believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged to
      you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose my aunt
      really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of
      consequence to anybody. Here, I know, I am of none, and yet I love
      the place so well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.
      You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even your
      constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change. You
      will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to choose from, the
      same people to look at, the same horse to ride.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how much
      I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as
      likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle&rsquo;s opening his
      lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind pains you took
      to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince me that I should
      like it after a little while, and feel how right you proved to be, I am
      inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good
      for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for your
      ultimate happiness too.&rdquo;
     
    
      So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it could
      render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had not the
      smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her, on the
      present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To prevent its
      being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank
      as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish, the White House being
      only just large enough to receive herself and her servants, and allow a
      spare room for a friend, of which she made a very particular point. The
      spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted, but the absolute
      necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten. Not all
      her precautions, however, could save her from being suspected of something
      better; or, perhaps, her very display of the importance of a spare room
      might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny. Lady
      Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to
      Mrs. Norris&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes to
      live with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Norris almost started. &ldquo;Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Is she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir
      Thomas.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to me.
      Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of, or for
      anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what could I do
      with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything, my
      spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at her time of life?
      A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need most attention and
      care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test! Sure Sir Thomas could
      not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is too much my friend.
      Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would propose it. How came Sir
      Thomas to speak to you about it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But what did he say? He could not say he wished me to take Fanny.
      I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We both
      thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it, there is
      no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any comfort
      to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of husbands,
      my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all
      my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support me in the
      rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the
      memory of the dear departed&mdash;what possible comfort could I have in
      taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it for my own sake,
      I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She is in good hands,
      and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my sorrows and
      difficulties as I can.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done, but
      I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I have
      been a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed to
      practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income. A
      great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the
      parish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was
      consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,
      matters must be better looked after. I must live within my income,
      or I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to
      be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say you will. You always do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me. It
      is for your children&rsquo;s good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody else
      to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little
      trifle among them worth their having.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are sure
      of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, you know, Sir Thomas&rsquo;s means will be rather straitened if the
      Antigua estate is to make such poor returns.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! that will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about
      it, I know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, Lady Bertram,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, &ldquo;I can only say that
      my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir Thomas
      should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say
      that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question; besides that,
      I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must keep a spare room
      for a friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to
      convince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law&rsquo;s views; and she
      was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the slightest
      allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at her refusing to do
      anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt; but, as she
      took early care to make him, as well as Lady Bertram, understand that
      whatever she possessed was designed for their family, he soon grew
      reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that it was
      advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better to provide
      for Fanny himself.
    
    
      Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and her
      spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some consolation
      to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so
      essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of the White
      House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,
      everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.
    
    
      The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave great
      satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had their
      faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond of
      eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of
      contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high wages
      as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her offices.
      Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances, nor of the
      quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house.
      &ldquo;Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself; nobody more hated
      pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had never been wanting in
      comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character in her time,
      but this was a way of going on that she could not understand. A fine lady
      in a country parsonage was quite out of place. Her store-room, she
      thought, might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into. Inquire
      where she would, she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more
      than five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective. She
      could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all the
      injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s being so well settled in life without
      being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as
      often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the other.
    
    
      These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose
      of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some place in the
      thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found it expedient to
      go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his affairs, and he
      took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detaching him from some bad
      connexions at home. They left England with the probability of being nearly
      a twelvemonth absent.
    
    
      The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
      utility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the
      rest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of
      others at their present most interesting time of life. He could not think
      Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather, to
      perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s watchful
      attention, and in Edmund&rsquo;s judgment, he had sufficient confidence to make
      him go without fears for their conduct.
    
    
      Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but she
      was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for his
      comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous, or
      difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.
    
    
      The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their
      sorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to
      them; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence
      was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint;
      and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been
      forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their own
      disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny&rsquo;s relief,
      and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins&rsquo;; but a more
      tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful, and she really
      grieved because she could not grieve. &ldquo;Sir Thomas, who had done so much
      for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps never to return! that
      she should see him go without a tear! it was a shameful insensibility.&rdquo; He
      had said to her, moreover, on the very last morning, that he hoped she
      might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter, and had
      charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron
      to which he belonged should be known to be in England. &ldquo;This was so
      thoughtful and kind!&rdquo; and would he only have smiled upon her, and called
      her &ldquo;my dear Fanny,&rdquo; while he said it, every former frown or cold address
      might have been forgotten. But he had ended his speech in a way to sink
      her in sad mortification, by adding, &ldquo;If William does come to Mansfield, I
      hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed
      since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without
      improvement; though, I fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some
      respects too much like his sister at ten.&rdquo; She cried bitterly over this
      reflection when her uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with
      red eyes, set her down as a hypocrite.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV
    
    
      Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could
      be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how
      very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund could supply
      his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to the attorney,
      settling with the servants, and equally saving her from all possible
      fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters.
    
    
      The earliest intelligence of the travellers&rsquo; safe arrival at Antigua,
      after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris had
      been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund
      participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended on
      being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe, she had
      already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others, when Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary
      to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.
    
    
      The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts
      continued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her
      nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments, and
      looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in addition
      to all her own household cares, some interference in those of her sister,
      and Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s wasteful doings to overlook, left her very little
      occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.
    
    
      The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the
      neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a
      manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and
      obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Their
      vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,
      and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,
      secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in
      believing they had no faults.
    
    
      Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters. She was too
      indolent even to accept a mother&rsquo;s gratification in witnessing their
      success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the
      charge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than a post
      of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished the means
      it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire.
    
    
      Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed being
      avowedly useful as her aunt&rsquo;s companion when they called away the rest of
      the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became
      everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party. She
      talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillity of such
      evenings, her perfect security in such a tete-a-tete from any sound
      of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom known a
      pause in its alarms or embarrassments. As to her cousins&rsquo; gaieties, she
      loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund
      had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she
      should ever be admitted to the same, and listened, therefore, without an
      idea of any nearer concern in them. Upon the whole, it was a comfortable
      winter to her; for though it brought no William to England, the
      never-failing hope of his arrival was worth much.
    
    
      The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey pony;
      and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as
      well as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of
      her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting her again,
      &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as it was observed by her aunts, &ldquo;she might ride one of her
      cousin&rsquo;s horses at any time when they did not want them,&rdquo; and as the Miss
      Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had no idea of
      carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure,
      that time, of course, never came. They took their cheerful rides in the
      fine mornings of April and May; and Fanny either sat at home the whole day
      with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at the instigation of the
      other: Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as
      it was unpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,
      thinking everybody ought to walk as much. Edmund was absent at this time,
      or the evil would have been earlier remedied. When he returned, to
      understand how Fanny was situated, and perceived its ill effects, there
      seemed with him but one thing to be done; and that &ldquo;Fanny must have a
      horse&rdquo; was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could
      be urged by the supineness of his mother, or the economy of his aunt, to
      make it appear unimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some
      steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park
      that would do vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward;
      or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to
      the post. She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and
      even improper, that Fanny should have a regular lady&rsquo;s horse of her own,
      in the style of her cousins. She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended
      it: and she must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence,
      and adding to the great expenses of his stable, at a time when a large
      part of his income was unsettled, seemed to her very unjustifiable. &ldquo;Fanny
      must have a horse,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see it
      in the same light. Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as
      to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary by his
      father; she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted
      him to wait till Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it
      all himself. He would be at home in September, and where would be the harm
      of only waiting till September?
    
    
      Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother,
      as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help paying more
      attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method of
      proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father&rsquo;s thinking he had
      done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means
      of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without. He had three
      horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman. Two of them were
      hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he resolved to
      exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew where such a one was
      to be met with; and having once made up his mind, the whole business was
      soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little trouble
      she became exactly calculated for the purpose, and Fanny was then put in
      almost full possession of her. She had not supposed before that anything
      could ever suit her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund&rsquo;s
      mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort; and the addition it
      was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her
      pleasure sprung, was beyond all her words to express. She regarded her
      cousin as an example of everything good and great, as possessing worth
      which no one but herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such
      gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her
      sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful,
      grateful, confiding, and tender.
    
    
      As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund,
      Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny&rsquo;s use; and had Lady Bertram
      ever thought about her own objection again, he might have been excused in
      her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return in September, for when
      September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and without any near prospect
      of finishing his business. Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen
      at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards
      England; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then
      involved determined him on sending home his son, and waiting the final
      arrangement by himself. Tom arrived safely, bringing an excellent account
      of his father&rsquo;s health; but to very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris
      was concerned. Sir Thomas&rsquo;s sending away his son seemed to her so like a
      parent&rsquo;s care, under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself,
      that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long
      evenings of autumn came on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the
      sad solitariness of her cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in
      the dining-room of the Park. The return of winter engagements, however,
      was not without its effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind
      became so pleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest
      niece, as tolerably to quiet her nerves. &ldquo;If poor Sir Thomas were fated
      never to return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria
      well married,&rdquo; she very often thought; always when they were in the
      company of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young
      man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest
      places in the country.
    
    
      Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram,
      and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He was a heavy
      young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was nothing
      disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased
      with her conquest. Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria Bertram was
      beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth
      would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father&rsquo;s, as well
      as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object, it became,
      by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident duty to marry Mr.
      Rushworth if she could. Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the
      match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its
      desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by seeking an
      intimacy with the gentleman&rsquo;s mother, who at present lived with him, and
      to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of
      indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It was not long before a good
      understanding took place between this lady and herself. Mrs. Rushworth
      acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry, and declared
      that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by
      her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted to make him
      happy. Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment, and admired the nice
      discernment of character which could so well distinguish merit. Maria was
      indeed the pride and delight of them all&mdash;perfectly faultless&mdash;an
      angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her
      choice: but yet, as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so
      short an acquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to
      deserve and attach her.
    
    
      After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young
      people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference
      to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of
      their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the
      neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s marrying Miss Bertram.
    
    
      It was some months before Sir Thomas&rsquo;s consent could be received; but, in
      the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the
      connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on without
      restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s talking
      of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present.
    
    
      Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the
      business; but no representation of his aunt&rsquo;s could induce him to find Mr.
      Rushworth a desirable companion. He could allow his sister to be the best
      judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her happiness
      should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from often saying to
      himself, in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s company&mdash;&ldquo;If this man had not twelve
      thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.&rdquo;
     
    
      Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so
      unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the
      perfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the right sort&mdash;in
      the same county, and the same interest&mdash;and his most hearty
      concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He only conditioned that the
      marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again
      looking eagerly forward to. He wrote in April, and had strong hopes of
      settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving Antigua before
      the end of the summer.
    
    
      Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just
      reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an
      addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford,
      the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were young people of
      fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty
      thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been always very fond of
      them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of
      their common parent, which left them to the care of a brother of their
      father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.
      In their uncle&rsquo;s house they had found a kind home. Admiral and Mrs.
      Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else, were united in affection for
      these children, or, at least, were no farther adverse in their feelings
      than that each had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest
      fondness of the two. The Admiral delighted in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted
      on the girl; and it was the lady&rsquo;s death which now obliged her protegee,
      after some months&rsquo; further trial at her uncle&rsquo;s house, to find another
      home. Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of
      retaining his niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this
      Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister&rsquo;s proposal of coming to her, a
      measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the
      other; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual resources
      of ladies residing in the country without a family of children&mdash;having
      more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and
      made a choice collection of plants and poultry&mdash;was very much in want
      of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had
      always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained
      single, was highly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield
      should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to
      London.
    
    
      Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though
      they arose principally from doubts of her sister&rsquo;s style of living and
      tone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to
      persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house, that she
      could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. To anything
      like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had,
      unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his sister in an
      article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the utmost kindness,
      into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at
      half an hour&rsquo;s notice, whenever she were weary of the place.
    
    
      The meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a
      sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister&rsquo;s husband who looked the
      gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant
      received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and
      woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkably
      pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners
      of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them
      credit for everything else. She was delighted with each, but Mary was her
      dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own,
      she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister&rsquo;s. She had
      not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her: she had
      fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a
      girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance and accomplishments
      which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved
      woman, Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what
      she had planned.
    
    
      Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near
      them, and not at all displeased either at her sister&rsquo;s early care, or the
      choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her object, provided she could
      marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that objection
      could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life. While
      she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to think of it
      seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.
    
    
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added Mrs. Grant, &ldquo;I have thought of something to make it
      complete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and
      therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,
      handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy.&rdquo;
     
    
      Henry bowed and thanked her.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;if you can persuade him into anything of the
      sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to
      anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen
      daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have
      the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English abilities can do has been
      tried already. I have three very particular friends who have been all
      dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they, their mothers (very
      clever women), as well as my dear aunt and myself, have taken to reason,
      coax, or trick him into marrying, is inconceivable! He is the most
      horrible flirt that can be imagined. If your Miss Bertrams do not like to
      have their hearts broke, let them avoid Henry.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear brother, I will not believe this of you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You will
      allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious temper,
      and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can think more
      highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the blessing of a
      wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet&mdash;&lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s
      last best gift.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look at
      his smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral&rsquo;s lessons have
      quite spoiled him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I pay very little regard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant, &ldquo;to what any young person
      says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it,
      I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.&rdquo;
     
    
      Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no
      disinclination to the state herself.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if
      they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves
      away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER V
    
    
      The young people were pleased with each other from the first. On each side
      there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as early
      an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s beauty did her
      no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsome themselves to
      dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as much charmed as
      their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown complexion, and
      general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, and fair, it might
      have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be no comparison;
      and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while they were the
      finest young women in the country.
    
    
      Her brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was
      absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with a
      pleasing address. The second meeting proved him not so very plain: he was
      plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his teeth were
      so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he was plain; and
      after a third interview, after dining in company with him at the
      Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. He was, in
      fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known, and they
      were equally delighted with him. Miss Bertram&rsquo;s engagement made him in
      equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before
      he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen in love
      with.
    
    
      Maria&rsquo;s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. She did
      not want to see or understand. &ldquo;There could be no harm in her liking an
      agreeable man&mdash;everybody knew her situation&mdash;Mr. Crawford must
      take care of himself.&rdquo; Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the
      Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he
      began with no object but of making them like him. He did not want them to
      die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge
      and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.
    
    
      &ldquo;I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,&rdquo; said he, as he returned
      from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; &ldquo;they
      are very elegant, agreeable girls.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you like
      Julia best.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I like Julia best.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the
      handsomest.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;So I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and I prefer
      her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly the
      handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall always
      like Julia best, because you order me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you will like her best
      at last.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do not I tell you that I like her best at first?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother. Her
      choice is made.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more
      agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are
      over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without
      suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it
      is a great match for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; that is your
      opinion of your intimate friend. I do not subscribe to it. I am
      sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it
      in her eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to
      suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mary, how shall we manage him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He will be
      taken in at last.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I would not have him taken in; I would not have him
      duped; I would have it all fair and honourable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just as
      well. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not always in marriage, dear Mary.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;In marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present
      company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a
      hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I
      will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be so,
      when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people
      expect most from others, and are least honest themselves.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but, however,
      speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business. I know so
      many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one
      particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality
      in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been
      obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a take in?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your
      pardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but half.
      You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will be little
      rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too
      much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to
      another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we
      find comfort somewhere&mdash;and those evil-minded observers, dearest
      Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in and deceived than the
      parties themselves.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well done, sister! I honour your esprit du corps.
      When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my
      friends in general would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.
      Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,
      and we will cure you.&rdquo;
     
    
      The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.
      Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry equally
      ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending to spend only a few
      days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was nothing to call
      him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her, and Dr.
      Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a talking pretty young
      woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent,
      stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s being his guest was an excuse for
      drinking claret every day.
    
    
      The Miss Bertrams&rsquo; admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than
      anything which Miss Crawford&rsquo;s habits made her likely to feel. She
      acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,
      that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and
      that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good. He
      had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than
      Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the
      eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment that
      she should like the eldest best. She knew it was her way.
    
    
      Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was
      the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of the
      kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp,
      for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance, and a
      great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a baronetcy,
      did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation
      might do. She looked about her with due consideration, and found almost
      everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles round, a
      spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened as to
      deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen&rsquo;s seats in the
      kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new furnished&mdash;pleasant
      sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man himself&mdash;with the
      advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his
      father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter. It might do very well; she
      believed she should accept him; and she began accordingly to interest
      herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B&mdash;&mdash;
      races.
    
    
      These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began;
      and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goings on,
      expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to an
      early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races,
      and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the eagerness of
      inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.
    
    
      And Fanny, what was she doing and thinking all this while? and what
      was her opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen
      could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,
      very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very
      plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary,
      she never mentioned him. The notice, which she excited herself, was
      to this effect. &ldquo;I begin now to understand you all, except Miss Price,&rdquo;
       said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams. &ldquo;Pray, is
      she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at the Parsonage, with the
      rest of you, which seemed like being out; and yet she says so
      little, that I can hardly suppose she is.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, &ldquo;I believe I know
      what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My cousin
      is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and not
      outs are beyond me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The
      distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally
      speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it
      possible to be mistaken as to a girl&rsquo;s being out or not. A girl not out
      has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
      very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I assure
      you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is all
      very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most objectionable part
      is, that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is
      frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass in such very little time from
      reserve to quite the opposite&mdash;to confidence! That is the
      faulty part of the present system. One does not like to see a girl of
      eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing&mdash;and perhaps
      when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. Mr. Bertram, I
      dare say you have sometimes met with such changes.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You are
      quizzing me and Miss Anderson.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am quite
      in the dark. But I will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if
      you will tell me what about.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed on.
      You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an altered
      young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly so. The
      Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the other day, you
      know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson. The circumstance
      was precisely as this lady has represented it. When Anderson first
      introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was not out,
      and I could not get her to speak to me. I sat there an hour one morning
      waiting for Anderson, with only her and a little girl or two in the room,
      the governess being sick or run away, and the mother in and out every
      moment with letters of business, and I could hardly get a word or a look
      from the young lady&mdash;nothing like a civil answer&mdash;she screwed up
      her mouth, and turned from me with such an air! I did not see her again
      for a twelvemonth. She was then out. I met her at Mrs. Holford&rsquo;s,
      and did not recollect her. She came up to me, claimed me as an
      acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I
      did not know which way to look. I felt that I must be the jest of the room
      at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has heard the story.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,
      than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers
      certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their
      daughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set
      people right, but I do see that they are often wrong.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Those who are showing the world what female manners should be,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Bertram gallantly, &ldquo;are doing a great deal to set them right.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The error is plain enough,&rdquo; said the less courteous Edmund; &ldquo;such girls
      are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They
      are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real
      modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. &ldquo;Yes, I cannot agree
      with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the business. It is
      much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take
      the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen done. That is worse
      than anything&mdash;quite disgusting!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, that is very inconvenient indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Bertram. &ldquo;It
      leads one astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and
      demure air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one
      what is expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want
      of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September,
      just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd&mdash;you have
      heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund&mdash;his father, and mother, and sisters,
      were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out; we
      went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds,
      with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; and as Mrs.
      Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her daughters,
      walked by her side all the way home, and made myself as agreeable as I
      could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and as ready to talk
      as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong.
      They looked just the same: both well-dressed, with veils and parasols like
      other girls; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my
      attention to the youngest, who was not out, and had most
      excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have been
      noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never
      forgiven me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger sister, I
      feel for her. To be neglected before one&rsquo;s time must be very vexatious;
      but it was entirely the mother&rsquo;s fault. Miss Augusta should have been with
      her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper. But now I must be
      satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls? Does she dine out every
      where, as well as at my sister&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Edmund; &ldquo;I do not think she has ever been to a ball. My
      mother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs.
      Grant, and Fanny stays at home with her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VI
    
    
      Mr. Bertram set off for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and Miss Crawford was
      prepared to find a great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly
      in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;
      and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going, she
      retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to
      feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. It would be a
      very flat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother, Edmund
      would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most
      spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,
      and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any
      former haunch, or a single entertaining story, about &ldquo;my friend such a
      one.&rdquo; She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end
      of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making his
      appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords&rsquo; arrival.
      He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and that friend
      having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver, Mr. Rushworth was
      returned with his head full of the subject, and very eager to be improving
      his own place in the same way; and though not saying much to the purpose,
      could talk of nothing else. The subject had been already handled in the
      drawing-room; it was revived in the dining-parlour. Miss Bertram&rsquo;s
      attention and opinion was evidently his chief aim; and though her
      deportment showed rather conscious superiority than any solicitude to
      oblige him, the mention of Sotherton Court, and the ideas attached to it,
      gave her a feeling of complacency, which prevented her from being very
      ungracious.
    
    
      &ldquo;I wish you could see Compton,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is the most complete thing! I
      never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not know where
      I was. The approach now, is one of the finest things in the
      country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare, when
      I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison&mdash;quite a
      dismal old prison.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, for shame!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;A prison indeed? Sotherton Court is
      the noblest old place in the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It wants improvement, ma&rsquo;am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that
      wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do not
      know what can be done with it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant
      to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; &ldquo;but depend upon it, Sotherton will have every
      improvement in time which his heart can desire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I must try to do something with it,&rdquo; said Mr. Rushworth, &ldquo;but I do not
      know what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your best friend upon such an occasion,&rdquo; said Miss Bertram calmly, &ldquo;would
      be Mr. Repton, I imagine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, I think
      I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, and if they were ten,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;I am sure you
      need not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you,
      I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in the
      best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton Court
      deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space to work
      upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part, if I
      had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, I should
      be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessively fond of
      it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now,
      with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. But if I had more
      room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting. We did
      a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made it quite a different
      place from what it was when we first had it. You young ones do not
      remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas were here, he
      could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more would have
      been done, but for poor Mr. Norris&rsquo;s sad state of health. He could hardly
      ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and that disheartened me
      from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had
      not been for that, we should have carried on the garden wall, and
      made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has
      done. We were always doing something as it was. It was only the spring
      twelvemonth before Mr. Norris&rsquo;s death that we put in the apricot against
      the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree, and getting to such
      perfection, sir,&rdquo; addressing herself then to Dr. Grant.
    
    
      &ldquo;The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,&rdquo; replied Dr. Grant. &ldquo;The
      soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should
      be so little worth the trouble of gathering.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost us&mdash;that
      is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill&mdash;and I know
      it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You were imposed on, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Dr. Grant: &ldquo;these potatoes have as
      much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It is
      an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which none
      from my garden are.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The truth is, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across the
      table to Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste
      of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it is so
      valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a remarkably
      large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves, my cook
      contrives to get them all.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little
      while, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.
      Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had
      begun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.
    
    
      After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. &ldquo;Smith&rsquo;s place is
      the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before Repton
      took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, &ldquo;if I were you, I would have a very
      pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and
      tried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission to
      her taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with
      the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in
      general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to
      please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech
      by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though not usually a great
      talker, had still more to say on the subject next his heart. &ldquo;Smith has
      not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds, which is little
      enough, and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so
      improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred, without
      reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so much could be done at
      Compton, we need not despair. There have been two or three fine old trees
      cut down, that grew too near the house, and it opens the prospect
      amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or anybody of that sort,
      would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down: the avenue that leads
      from the west front to the top of the hill, you know,&rdquo; turning to Miss
      Bertram particularly as he spoke. But Miss Bertram thought it most
      becoming to reply&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;The avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of
      Sotherton.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite Miss
      Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at him, and
      said in a low voice&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Cut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?
      &lsquo;Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      He smiled as he answered, &ldquo;I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,
      Fanny.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place as
      it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Have you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out
      of distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it
      has been altered.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I collect,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, &ldquo;that Sotherton is an old place, and a
      place of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The house was built in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, and is a large, regular, brick
      building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It is
      ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that
      respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and there
      is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr.
      Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,
      and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, &ldquo;He is a
      well-bred man; he makes the best of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but, had I a
      place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an
      improver. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own
      choice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own
      blunders than by his.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You would know what you were about, of course; but that would not
      suit me. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they
      are before me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be
      most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as
      much beauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till
      it was complete.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all,&rdquo; said
      Fanny.
    
    
      &ldquo;Ay, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; and
      the only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favourite in
      the world, has made me consider improvements in hand as the
      greatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle,
      bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in; and my
      aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being excessively
      pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for three months
      we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to step on, or a
      bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete as possible in the
      country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic seats innumerable: but
      it must all be done without my care. Henry is different; he loves to be
      doing.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to
      admire, speak so freely of her uncle. It did not suit his sense of
      propriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and
      liveliness to put the matter by for the present.
    
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Bertram,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have tidings of my harp at last. I am assured
      that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been these ten
      days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the
      contrary.&rdquo; Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise. &ldquo;The truth is, that
      our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant, we went ourselves: this
      will not do seventy miles from London; but this morning we heard of it in
      the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller, and the
      miller told the butcher, and the butcher&rsquo;s son-in-law left word at the
      shop.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope
      there will be no further delay.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed? Not
      by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in the
      village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a
      very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want a
      horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to
      speak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet
      without seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing
      another, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved
      that I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when I
      found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible thing
      in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers, all the hay
      in the parish! As for Dr. Grant&rsquo;s bailiff, I believe I had better keep out
      of his way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in
      general, looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but when
      you do think of it, you must see the importance of getting in the
      grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose:
      our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest, it
      must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the true
      London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a little
      embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs.
      However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is good-nature
      itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it not be honourably
      conveyed?&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be soon
      allowed to hear her. Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and wished for
      it very much.
    
    
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy to play to you both,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford; &ldquo;at least
      as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I dearly love
      music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the player must always
      be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one. Now, Mr. Bertram,
      if you write to your brother, I entreat you to tell him that my harp is
      come: he heard so much of my misery about it. And you may say, if you
      please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return, in
      compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse will lose.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,
      foresee any occasion for writing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever
      write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would
      never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not
      write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and
      when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such a
      relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but one
      style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect
      exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in
      me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the
      page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than&mdash;&lsquo;Dear Mary,
      I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything as usual. Yours
      sincerely.&rsquo; That is the true manly style; that is a complete brother&rsquo;s
      letter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;When they are at a distance from all their family,&rdquo; said Fanny, colouring
      for William&rsquo;s sake, &ldquo;they can write long letters.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Miss Price has a brother at sea,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;whose excellence as a
      correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;At sea, has she? In the king&rsquo;s service, of course?&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined
      silence obliged her to relate her brother&rsquo;s situation: her voice was
      animated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had
      been on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been
      absent without tears in her eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him an
      early promotion.
    
    
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of my cousin&rsquo;s captain?&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;Captain
      Marshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Among admirals, large enough; but,&rdquo; with an air of grandeur, &ldquo;we know
      very little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort of
      men, but they do not belong to us. Of various admirals I could tell
      you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay,
      and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure you
      that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my home
      at my uncle&rsquo;s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears
      and Vices I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun, I
      entreat.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, &ldquo;It is a noble profession.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make
      the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it is
      not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable form to
      me.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of
      hearing her play.
    
    
      The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under consideration
      among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing her brother,
      though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia Bertram.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Henry, have you nothing to say? You have been an improver
      yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place in
      England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham, as it used
      to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of ground, and such
      timber! What would I not give to see it again?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,&rdquo; was
      his answer; &ldquo;but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not
      find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere nothing; you
      would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for improvement, there
      was very little for me to do&mdash;too little: I should like to have been
      busy much longer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are fond of the sort of thing?&rdquo; said Julia.
    
    
      &ldquo;Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which
      pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,
      and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three months
      before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid at Westminster,
      a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at one-and-twenty executed. I
      am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before
      him. I have been a devourer of my own.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,&rdquo; said
      Julia. &ldquo;You can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.
      Rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,
      persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother&rsquo;s; and as Miss
      Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,
      declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult with
      friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the business
      into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very ready to
      request the favour of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s assistance; and Mr. Crawford, after
      properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at his service in any
      way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr.
      Crawford&rsquo;s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton, and taking a
      bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her two nieces&rsquo; minds their
      little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away,
      interposed with an amendment.
    
    
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s willingness; but why should not
      more of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many that
      would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, and that
      would like to hear Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s opinion on the spot, and that might be
      of some small use to you with their opinions; and, for my own part,
      I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing but
      having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but now I could
      go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the rest of you walked
      about and settled things, and then we could all return to a late dinner
      here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most agreeable to your
      mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight. I dare say Mr.
      Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche, and Edmund can
      go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at home with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going was
      forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund, who heard
      it all and said nothing.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VII
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford now?&rdquo; said Edmund
      the next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. &ldquo;How did
      you like her yesterday?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me;
      and she is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at
      her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play of
      feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you, Fanny,
      as not quite right?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was quite
      astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years, and who,
      whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him,
      they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And very ungrateful, I think.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claim
      to her gratitude; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of
      her respect for her aunt&rsquo;s memory which misleads her here. She is
      awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it
      must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,
      without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which
      was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral&rsquo;s present
      conduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and
      amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not
      censure her opinions; but there certainly is impropriety in
      making them public.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do not you think,&rdquo; said Fanny, after a little consideration, &ldquo;that this
      impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has
      been entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her right notions
      of what was due to the Admiral.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to
      have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the
      disadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do her
      good. Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s manners are just what they ought to be. She speaks of
      her brother with a very pleasing affection.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me almost
      laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a
      brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth
      reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William would
      never have used me so, under any circumstances. And what right had
      she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were
      absent?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to its
      own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when untinctured by
      ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the
      countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or loud, or coarse.
      She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we have been speaking
      of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw it all as I did.&rdquo;
     
    
      Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance of
      her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject, there
      began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a line of
      admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could not
      follow. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s attractions did not lessen. The harp arrived, and
      rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she played with the
      greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste which were peculiarly
      becoming, and there was something clever to be said at the close of every
      air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his
      favourite instrument: one morning secured an invitation for the next; for
      the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was
      soon in a fair train.
    
    
      A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and both
      placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a little
      lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough to
      catch any man&rsquo;s heart. The season, the scene, the air, were all favourable
      to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not
      without their use: it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to
      account when love is once set going, even the sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant
      doing the honours of it, were worth looking at. Without studying the
      business, however, or knowing what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at
      the end of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to
      the credit of the lady it may be added that, without his being a man of
      the world or an elder brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the
      gaieties of small talk, he began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be
      so, though she had not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he
      was not pleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no
      compliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and
      simple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his
      integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to
      discuss with herself. She did not think very much about it, however: he
      pleased her for the present; she liked to have him near her; it was
      enough.
    
    
      Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning; she
      would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited and
      unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the
      evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should
      think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, while
      Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it a
      very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water
      for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a little surprised
      that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of
      the sort of fault which he had already observed, and of which she
      was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she
      was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was fond of speaking to her of
      Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since
      been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him, lest it
      should appear like ill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford
      occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride,
      which the former caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from
      the example of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund&rsquo;s
      acquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and the
      offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts, as the
      best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No pain, no
      injury, however, was designed by him to his cousin in this offer: she
      was not to lose a day&rsquo;s exercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down
      to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny, on
      its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost
      over-powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.
    
    
      Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no
      inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided
      at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny or
      the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without her
      cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day&rsquo;s trial was not so
      guiltless. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not
      know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and though rather small,
      strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure genuine
      pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in Edmund&rsquo;s
      attendance and instructions, and something more in the conviction of very
      much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her
      unwilling to dismount. Fanny was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was
      beginning to scold her for not being gone, and still no horse was
      announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her aunt, and look for him, she
      went out.
    
    
      The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of
      each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could look
      down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes,
      gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant&rsquo;s meadow she
      immediately saw the group&mdash;Edmund and Miss Crawford both on
      horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,
      with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party it
      appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a doubt,
      for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound which did
      not make her cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should forget her,
      and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the meadow; she could
      not help watching all that passed. At first Miss Crawford and her
      companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a foot&rsquo;s
      pace; then, at her apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter;
      and to Fanny&rsquo;s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she
      sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund was close to her;
      he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her management of the
      bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination supplied
      what the eye could not reach. She must not wonder at all this; what could
      be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful, and
      proving his good-nature by any one? She could not but think, indeed, that
      Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble; that it would have
      been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it
      himself; but Mr. Crawford, with all his boasted good-nature, and all his
      coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the matter, and had no active
      kindness in comparison of Edmund. She began to think it rather hard upon
      the mare to have such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare
      should be remembered.
    
    
      Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by
      seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on
      horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the
      lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood. She
      began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked to
      meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.
    
    
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Price,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all within
      hearing, &ldquo;I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting; but
      I have nothing in the world to say for myself&mdash;I knew it was very
      late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if you please,
      you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven, you know,
      because there is no hope of a cure.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction that
      she could be in no hurry. &ldquo;For there is more than time enough for my
      cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you have been
      promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour
      sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as
      she would have done then. I wish you may not be fatigued by so much
      exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,&rdquo; said
      she, as she sprang down with his help; &ldquo;I am very strong. Nothing ever
      fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to you
      with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride,
      and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear, delightful,
      beautiful animal.&rdquo;
     
    
      The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now
      joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another
      part of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as
      she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to
      the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been
      watching with an interest almost equal to her own.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to have a
      thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began, six
      years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble when Sir
      Thomas first had you put on!&rdquo;
     
    
      In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit in being
      gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the
      Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her early
      excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure in
      praising it.
    
    
      &ldquo;I was sure she would ride well,&rdquo; said Julia; &ldquo;she has the make for it.
      Her figure is as neat as her brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Maria, &ldquo;and her spirits are as good, and she has the same
      energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great
      deal to do with the mind.&rdquo;
     
    
      When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the
      next day.
    
    
      &ldquo;No, I do not know&mdash;not if you want the mare,&rdquo; was her answer.
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not want her at all for myself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but whenever you are next
      inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her
      a longer time&mdash;for a whole morning, in short. She has a great desire
      to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its
      fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it. But
      any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry to interfere
      with you. It would be very wrong if she did. She rides only for
      pleasure; you for health.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;I have been out very
      often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong enough
      now to walk very well.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny&rsquo;s comfort, and the ride to
      Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all the
      young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly
      enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this sort
      generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield Common
      disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There were many
      other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there were shady
      lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is always provided with a
      shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner, in
      shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the honours of its finest
      spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat
      only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure&mdash;till
      the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly
      clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund and Julia were invited to dine
      at the Parsonage, and she was excluded. It was meant and done by
      Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s account, who was
      partly expected at the Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous
      injury, and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation
      and anger till she reached home. As Mr. Rushworth did not come, the
      injury was increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power
      over him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and
      throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.
    
    
      Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,
      fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of what
      they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would scarcely
      raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even
      Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece&rsquo;s ill-humour, and having asked one
      or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately attended to,
      seemed almost determined to say no more. For a few minutes the brother and
      sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on
      the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the first pause came,
      Edmund, looking around, said, &ldquo;But where is Fanny? Is she gone to bed?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, not that I know of,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Norris; &ldquo;she was here a moment
      ago.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was a
      very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began
      scolding.
    
    
      &ldquo;That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening
      upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as we
      do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor
      basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week, not
      touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You
      should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a
      shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.&rdquo;
     
    
      Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,
      and had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour,
      from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, &ldquo;I must
      say, ma&rsquo;am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the
      house.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, &ldquo;I am sure you
      have the headache.&rdquo;
     
    
      She could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.
    
    
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe you,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I know your looks too well. How
      long have you had it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Did you go out in the heat?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Go out! to be sure she did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris: &ldquo;would you have her stay
      within such a fine day as this? Were not we all out? Even your
      mother was out to-day for above an hour.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, Edmund,&rdquo; added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly
      awakened by Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s sharp reprimand to Fanny; &ldquo;I was out above an
      hour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny
      cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It
      was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming
      home again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! She
      found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not wait.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There was no help for it, certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rather
      softened voice; &ldquo;but I question whether her headache might not be caught
      then, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and
      stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose
      you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have mine
      filled.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She has got it,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;she has had it ever since she came
      back from your house the second time.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Edmund; &ldquo;has she been walking as well as cutting roses;
      walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma&rsquo;am? No
      wonder her head aches.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.
    
    
      &ldquo;I was afraid it would be too much for her,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;but when
      the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then you know
      they must be taken home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,
      Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she
      was obliged to go again.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, &ldquo;And could nobody be
      employed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma&rsquo;am, it has been a
      very ill-managed business.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Norris, unable to be longer deaf; &ldquo;unless I had gone myself, indeed; but I
      cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that
      very time about your mother&rsquo;s dairymaid, by her desire, and had
      promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son, and the poor
      fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can justly accuse
      me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I cannot do everything
      at once. And as for Fanny&rsquo;s just stepping down to my house for me&mdash;it
      is not much above a quarter of a mile&mdash;I cannot think I was
      unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day, early
      and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be knocked
      up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this long while, and I
      am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to walk. If she had
      been riding before, I should not have asked it of her. But I thought it
      would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there
      is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and
      though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot. Between ourselves,
      Edmund,&rdquo; nodding significantly at his mother, &ldquo;it was cutting the roses,
      and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the mischief.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid it was, indeed,&rdquo; said the more candid Lady Bertram, who had
      overheard her; &ldquo;I am very much afraid she caught the headache there, for
      the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bear
      myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from the
      flower-beds, was almost too much for me.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table, on
      which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny,
      and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be able to
      decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made it
      easier to swallow than to speak.
    
    
      Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry with
      himself. His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they
      had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly
      considered; but she had been left four days together without any choice of
      companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her
      unreasonable aunts might require. He was ashamed to think that for four
      days together she had not had the power of riding, and very seriously
      resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s, that it should never happen again.
    
    
      Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her
      arrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had its share
      in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and been
      struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she leant on
      the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain
      of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden change
      which Edmund&rsquo;s kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know how to
      support herself.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VIII
    
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant
      fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, Edmund
      trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made
      good. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother, who
      came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging the
      execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started a
      fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent absence from
      home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well
      pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreed to,
      provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies did not
      forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have
      answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor
      run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth
      discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to
      the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether
      Wednesday would suit him or not.
    
    
      Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out
      some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met him.
      Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at
      home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was hardly
      possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for Mrs. Norris
      was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a well-meaning, civil,
      prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence, but as it
      related to her own and her son&rsquo;s concerns, had not yet given over pressing
      Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady Bertram constantly declined it; but
      her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to
      come, till Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her
      of the truth.
    
    
      &ldquo;The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I
      assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you
      know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two
      dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that could
      give her a wish to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She will
      have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;
      and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer
      for his being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback, you
      know.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s staying at home,
      could only be sorry. &ldquo;The loss of her ladyship&rsquo;s company would be a great
      drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young
      lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and it was a
      pity she should not see the place.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Norris; &ldquo;but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing
      Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is quite out
      of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must be
      wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation; and
      though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs.
      Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it on
      her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister; and
      Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in accepting her share
      of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful;
      and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled
      for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage, and walk half-way
      down the park with the two other ladies.
    
    
      On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to make
      up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford&rsquo;s being of the party were
      desirable or not, or whether her brother&rsquo;s barouche would not be full
      without her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that the
      barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on which
      one might go with him.
    
    
      &ldquo;But why is it necessary,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;that Crawford&rsquo;s carriage, or his
      only, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother&rsquo;s
      chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,
      understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage
      of the family.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Julia: &ldquo;go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,
      when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not
      quite do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us.
      After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And, my dear Edmund,&rdquo; added Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;taking out two carriages
      when one will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between
      ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and
      Sotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his
      carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas, when
      he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
      Maria; &ldquo;but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and does not
      know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no
      inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;in
      going on the barouche box.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Unpleasant!&rdquo; cried Maria: &ldquo;oh dear! I believe it would be generally
      thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one&rsquo;s view of
      the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box herself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There can be no objection, then, to Fanny&rsquo;s going with you; there can be
      no doubt of your having room for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Norris; &ldquo;my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her
      going with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She is
      not expected.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,&rdquo; said he, addressing his
      mother, &ldquo;for wishing Fanny not to be of the party, but as it
      relates to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you
      would not wish to keep her at home?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure not, but I cannot do without her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.&rdquo;
     
    
      There was a general cry out at this. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there is no
      necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great
      desire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not often
      a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma&rsquo;am, you would be glad to
      give her the pleasure now?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain&mdash;their
      having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go, and the
      very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her, which
      seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over. It must have
      the strangest appearance! It would be something so very unceremonious, so
      bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whose own manners were such a
      pattern of good-breeding and attention, that she really did not feel equal
      to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny, and no wish of procuring
      her pleasure at any time; but her opposition to Edmund now, arose
      more from partiality for her own scheme, because it was her own,
      than from anything else. She felt that she had arranged everything
      extremely well, and that any alteration must be for the worse. When
      Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she would give him
      the hearing, that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s
      account, because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked with her
      through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of
      the party, and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his
      cousin, Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace,
      and would only say, &ldquo;Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it
      your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It seems very odd,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;that you should be staying at home
      instead of Fanny.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,&rdquo; added Julia, hastily
      leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she ought to
      offer to stay at home herself.
    
    
      &ldquo;Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s
      only reply, and the subject dropt.
    
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater
      than her pleasure. She felt Edmund&rsquo;s kindness with all, and more than all,
      the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment, could be
      aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her
      pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing
      without him.
    
    
      The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another alteration
      in the plan, and one that was admitted with general approbation. Mrs.
      Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of
      her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner. Lady Bertram was very
      well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies were in spirits again.
      Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his
      share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had
      it at her tongue&rsquo;s end, and was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs.
      Grant spoke.
    
    
      Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.
      Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was
      nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take
      their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of
      honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While each
      of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most
      appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled by
      Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s saying, as she stepped from the carriage, &ldquo;As there are five
      of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as you were
      saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think this will be
      a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.&rdquo;
     
    
      Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a
      moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and
      the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,
      and the barking of Pug in his mistress&rsquo;s arms.
    
    
      Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had
      never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy in
      observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She was not
      often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did she
      desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best
      companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the bearings
      of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the
      cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that could
      only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt.
      That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by
      her: in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike
      her. She had none of Fanny&rsquo;s delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she
      saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation; her attention was
      all for men and women, her talents for the light and lively. In looking
      back after Edmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind
      them, or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they
      were united, and a &ldquo;there he is&rdquo; broke at the same moment from them both,
      more than once.
    
    
      For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort: her
      prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side,
      full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his expressive profile
      as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh of the other,
      was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own sense of propriety
      could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back, it was with a
      countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was in the
      highest spirits: &ldquo;her view of the country was charming, she wished they
      could all see it,&rdquo; etc.; but her only offer of exchange was addressed to
      Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill, and was not more
      inviting than this: &ldquo;Here is a fine burst of country. I wish you had my
      seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever so much;&rdquo;
       and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a
      good pace.
    
    
      When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was
      better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her bow.
      She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in the vicinity of
      Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s consequence
      was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that &ldquo;those woods belonged to
      Sotherton,&rdquo; she could not carelessly observe that &ldquo;she believed that it
      was now all Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s property on each side of the road,&rdquo; without
      elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to
      the capital freehold mansion, and ancient manorial residence of the
      family, with all its rights of court-leet and court-baron.
    
    
      &ldquo;Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties are
      over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth has
      made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village. Those
      cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned remarkably
      handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often
      happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be terrible. There
      is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understand the clergyman and
      his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses, built by some of
      the family. To the right is the steward&rsquo;s house; he is a very respectable
      man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile
      through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, at this end; there is
      some fine timber, but the situation of the house is dreadful. We go down
      hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an
      ill-looking place if it had a better approach.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment
      to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility; and even Fanny
      had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with complacency.
      Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach; and after being
      at some pains to get a view of the house, and observing that &ldquo;it was a
      sort of building which she could not look at but with respect,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;Now, where is the avenue? The house fronts the east, I perceive. The
      avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the
      west front.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and
      ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see
      something of it here&mdash;something of the more distant trees. It is oak
      entirely.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had
      known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her
      spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish, when
      they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IX
    
    
      Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole
      party were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they
      were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all the
      distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of arriving
      was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were thrown open to
      admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed
      dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance and
      elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. The
      particular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. Crawford
      like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds? Mr.
      Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford suggested the greater
      desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. &ldquo;To be
      depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,
      might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this was
      scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled nor
      spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them as had
      not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was pleased
      to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing something.
    
    
      The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s guidance were
      shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and amply
      furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors, solid
      mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome in its
      way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, but the larger
      part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybody but Mrs.
      Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper
      could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house.
      On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and
      Fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention;
      for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of great houses, and cared for none
      of them, had only the appearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to
      whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new, attended with
      unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the
      family in former times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal
      efforts, delighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm
      her imagination with scenes of the past.
    
    
      The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from
      any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending
      Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at
      the windows. Every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the
      beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisades and gates.
    
    
      Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other
      use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for
      housemaids, &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth, &ldquo;we are coming to the chapel,
      which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but as we
      are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will excuse
      me.&rdquo;
     
    
      They entered. Fanny&rsquo;s imagination had prepared her for something grander
      than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of devotion:
      with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany,
      and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family
      gallery above. &ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice, to Edmund.
      &ldquo;This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful here, nothing
      melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions,
      no banners. No banners, cousin, to be &lsquo;blown by the night wind of heaven.&rsquo; 
      No signs that a &lsquo;Scottish monarch sleeps below.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how
      confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and
      monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have been
      buried, I suppose, in the parish church. There you must look for
      the banners and the achievements.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth began her relation. &ldquo;This chapel was fitted up as you see
      it, in James the Second&rsquo;s time. Before that period, as I understand, the
      pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the
      linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth;
      but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was formerly
      in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always read in it
      by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the late Mr.
      Rushworth left it off.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Every generation has its improvements,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, with a smile,
      to Edmund.
    
    
      Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and Edmund,
      Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; cried Fanny, &ldquo;that the custom should have been
      discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something
      in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with
      one&rsquo;s ideas of what such a household should be! A whole family assembling
      regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very fine indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, laughing. &ldquo;It must do the heads of
      the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and
      footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice a
      day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is hardly Fanny&rsquo;s idea of a family assembling,&rdquo; said Edmund.
      &ldquo;If the master and mistress do not attend themselves, there must be
      more harm than good in the custom.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such
      subjects. Everybody likes to go their own way&mdash;to chuse their own
      time and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality,
      the restraint, the length of time&mdash;altogether it is a formidable
      thing, and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and
      gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come
      when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke
      with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,
      they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what
      unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a
      time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets&mdash;starched
      up into seeming piety, but with heads full of something very different&mdash;especially
      if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at&mdash;and, in those days, I
      fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now.&rdquo;
     
    
      For a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund,
      but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little recollection before
      he could say, &ldquo;Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious
      subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch, and human nature cannot say
      it was not so. We must all feel at times the difficulty of
      fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are supposing it a
      frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a habit from
      neglect, what could be expected from the private devotions of such
      persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, which are indulged in
      wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a closet?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour.
      There would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would
      not be tried so long.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The mind which does not struggle against itself under one
      circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the other, I
      believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse
      better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,
      however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One
      wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to
      forget what chapel prayers are.&rdquo;
     
    
      While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the
      chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s attention to her sister, by saying,
      &ldquo;Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as if
      the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely the air
      of it?&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria, said,
      in a voice which she only could hear, &ldquo;I do not like to see Miss Bertram
      so near the altar.&rdquo;
     
    
      Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering
      herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not much
      louder, &ldquo;If he would give her away?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,&rdquo; was his reply, with a look of
      meaning.
    
    
      Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.
    
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place directly,
      if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether, and nothing in
      the world could be more snug and pleasant.&rdquo; And she talked and laughed
      about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr.
      Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to the whispered
      gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles
      and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.
    
    
      &ldquo;If Edmund were but in orders!&rdquo; cried Julia, and running to where he stood
      with Miss Crawford and Fanny: &ldquo;My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders
      now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that you are not
      ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a
      disinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea she
      was receiving. Fanny pitied her. &ldquo;How distressed she will be at what she
      said just now,&rdquo; passed across her mind.
    
    
      &ldquo;Ordained!&rdquo; said Miss Crawford; &ldquo;what, are you to be a clergyman?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father&rsquo;s return&mdash;probably at
      Christmas.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,
      replied only, &ldquo;If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the
      cloth with more respect,&rdquo; and turned the subject.
    
    
      The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which
      reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss Bertram,
      displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to feel that they
      had been there long enough.
    
    
      The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.
      Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the
      principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her
      son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. &ldquo;For if,&rdquo;
       said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a clearer
      head does not always avoid, &ldquo;we are too long going over the house,
      we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It is past
      two, and we are to dine at five.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds, with
      the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and Mrs. Norris
      was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most
      could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,
      temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and
      shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, one
      wish for air and liberty, all walked out.
    
    
      &ldquo;Suppose we turn down here for the present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth, civilly
      taking the hint and following them. &ldquo;Here are the greatest number of our
      plants, and here are the curious pheasants.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Query,&rdquo; said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, &ldquo;whether we may not find
      something to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great
      promise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;James,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, &ldquo;I believe the wilderness will be
      new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness
      yet.&rdquo;
     
    
      No objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to
      move in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by the
      plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.
      Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of
      that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,
      contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond the
      bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, and
      commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness
      immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr. Crawford
      was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when, after a
      little time, the others began to form into parties, these three were found
      in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny,
      who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short participation of
      their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on. The remaining
      three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, were still far behind; for
      Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the
      side of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her impatient feet to that lady&rsquo;s
      slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was
      come out to feed the pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her.
      Poor Julia, the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with
      their lot, was now in a state of complete penance, and as different from
      the Julia of the barouche-box as could well be imagined. The politeness
      which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for
      her to escape; while the want of that higher species of self-command, that
      just consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart, that
      principle of right, which had not formed any essential part of her
      education, made her miserable under it.
    
    
      &ldquo;This is insufferably hot,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one
      turn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the
      middle which opened to the wilderness. &ldquo;Shall any of us object to being
      comfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it. What
      happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is; for in
      these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they
      like.&rdquo;
     
    
      The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in
      turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day
      behind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,
      which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of larch
      and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much
      regularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with the
      bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it, and
      for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a short pause,
      Miss Crawford began with, &ldquo;So you are to be a clergyman, Mr. Bertram. This
      is rather a surprise to me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some
      profession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a soldier,
      nor a sailor.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there
      is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second
      son.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A very praiseworthy practice,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;but not quite universal. I
      am one of the exceptions, and being one, must do something for
      myself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought that was always the
      lot of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Never is a black word. But yes, in the never of
      conversation, which means not very often, I do think
      it. For what is to be done in the church? Men love to distinguish
      themselves, and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained,
      but not in the church. A clergyman is nothing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The nothing of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as
      the never. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He must
      not head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation
      nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to
      mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and
      eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and
      consequently of the manners which result from their influence. No one here
      can call the office nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it is
      by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and stepping
      out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been
      used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see much
      of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be acquired
      where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons a week, even
      supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to
      prefer Blair&rsquo;s to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct
      and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?
      One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are speaking of London, I am speaking of the nation at
      large.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the
      kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not
      there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it
      certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt.
      A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine preaching
      only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his
      neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of
      knowing his private character, and observing his general conduct, which in
      London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost there in the crowds of
      their parishioners. They are known to the largest part only as preachers.
      And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must
      not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of
      good-breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of
      the ceremonies of life. The manners I speak of might rather be
      called conduct, perhaps, the result of good principles; the effect,
      in short, of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and
      recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy
      are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.
    
    
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Miss Crawford, &ldquo;you have quite convinced Miss Price
      already.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not think you ever will,&rdquo; said she, with an arch smile; &ldquo;I am just
      as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take
      orders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change your
      mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this
      wilderness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness
      of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon
      mot, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very
      matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a
      repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.&rdquo;
     
    
      A general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the first
      interruption by saying, &ldquo;I wonder that I should be tired with only walking
      in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not
      disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,
      &ldquo;how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,&rdquo;
       turning to Miss Crawford, &ldquo;my other companion may do me the honour of
      taking an arm.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I am not at all tired.&rdquo; She took it, however, as she
      spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a
      connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny. &ldquo;You
      scarcely touch me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You do not make me of any use. What a
      difference in the weight of a woman&rsquo;s arm from that of a man! At Oxford I
      have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a
      street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have walked
      at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not half a mile,&rdquo; was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in
      love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken such
      a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile long in
      a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left
      the first great path.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw
      directly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it
      closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in
      length.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long
      wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it;
      and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak
      within compass.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,&rdquo; said Edmund, taking out
      his watch. &ldquo;Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too
      slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.&rdquo;
     
    
      A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they
      had been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and
      looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on
      which they all sat down.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund, observing her; &ldquo;why
      would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day&rsquo;s amusement for you if
      you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon,
      Miss Crawford, except riding.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all
      last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen
      again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my
      own neglect. Fanny&rsquo;s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there is
      nothing in the course of one&rsquo;s duties so fatiguing as what we have been
      doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to
      another, straining one&rsquo;s eyes and one&rsquo;s attention, hearing what one does
      not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally
      allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found it
      so, though she did not know it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall soon be rested,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;to sit in the shade on a fine day,
      and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.&rdquo;
     
    
      After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. &ldquo;I must move,&rdquo;
       said she; &ldquo;resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I am
      weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view, without
      being able to see it so well.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund left the seat likewise. &ldquo;Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up
      the walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,
      or half half a mile.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is an immense distance,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I see that with a glance.&rdquo;
     
    
      He still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, she
      would not compare. She would only smile and assert. The greatest degree of
      rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they talked
      with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should endeavour
      to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it.
      They would go to one end of it, in the line they were then in&mdash;for
      there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the side of the ha-ha&mdash;and
      perhaps turn a little way in some other direction, if it seemed likely to
      assist them, and be back in a few minutes. Fanny said she was rested, and
      would have moved too, but this was not suffered. Edmund urged her
      remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist,
      and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin&rsquo;s care,
      but with great regret that she was not stronger. She watched them till
      they had turned the corner, and listened till all sound of them had
      ceased.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER X
    
    
      A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still
      thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption from
      any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to listen
      with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again. She
      listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet approaching;
      but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted, when
      Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path
      which she had trod herself, and were before her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Price all alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;My dear Fanny, how comes this?&rdquo; were the first
      salutations. She told her story. &ldquo;Poor dear Fanny,&rdquo; cried her cousin, &ldquo;how
      ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid with us.&rdquo;
     
    
      Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed the
      conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the possibility
      of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed on; but Henry
      Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally speaking, whatever
      he proposed was immediately approved, first by her, and then by Mr.
      Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others, and
      who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they
      had seen his friend Smith&rsquo;s place.
    
    
      After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron
      gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their
      views and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very thing
      of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way of
      proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford&rsquo;s opinion; and he
      directly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly
      the requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that knoll,
      and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth wished he
      had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether he should not
      bring the key; he was determined he would never come without the key
      again; but still this did not remove the present evil. They could not get
      through; and as Miss Bertram&rsquo;s inclination for so doing did by no means
      lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s declaring outright that he would go
      and fetch the key. He set off accordingly.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from the
      house already,&rdquo; said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you
      find the place altogether worse than you expected?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in
      its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the
      truth,&rdquo; speaking rather lower, &ldquo;I do not think that I shall ever
      see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will
      hardly improve it to me.&rdquo;
     
    
      After a moment&rsquo;s embarrassment the lady replied, &ldquo;You are too much a man
      of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people think
      Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good
      for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor my
      memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case
      with men of the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. &ldquo;You
      seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to see
      you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection at
      what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an
      old Irish groom of my uncle&rsquo;s. Your sister loves to laugh.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You think her more light-hearted than I am?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;More easily amused,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;consequently, you know,&rdquo; smiling,
      &ldquo;better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish
      anecdotes during a ten miles&rsquo; drive.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to think
      of now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high
      spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too fair
      to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,
      certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But unluckily
      that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship.
      &lsquo;I cannot get out,&rsquo; as the starling said.&rdquo; As she spoke, and it was with
      expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her. &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth is so
      long fetching this key!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s authority and protection, or I think you might with little
      difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance; I
      think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and
      could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will. Mr.
      Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of
      sight.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find
      us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to
      prevent it. &ldquo;You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you will
      certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown; you
      will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better not go.&rdquo;
     
    
      Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken, and,
      smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, &ldquo;Thank you, my dear
      Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant
      feelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,
      astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking a
      circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable direction
      to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some minutes longer
      she remained without sight or sound of any companion. She seemed to have
      the little wood all to herself. She could almost have thought that Edmund
      and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was impossible for Edmund to
      forget her so entirely.
    
    
      She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
      somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She expected
      Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath, and with a
      look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, &ldquo;Heyday! Where are the
      others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny explained.
    
    
      &ldquo;A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,&rdquo; looking
      eagerly into the park. &ldquo;But they cannot be very far off, and I think I am
      equal to as much as Maria, even without help.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do wait
      for Mr. Rushworth.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,
      child, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a
      penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed
      and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my
      place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let
      it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that it
      would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she had
      not seen Mr. Rushworth.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death, and
      could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all were.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That is Miss Maria&rsquo;s concern. I am not obliged to punish myself
      for her sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome
      aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I can get
      away from.&rdquo;
     
    
      And she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not
      attending to Fanny&rsquo;s last question of whether she had seen anything of
      Miss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of
      seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued
      absence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had been very
      ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed.
      He joined her within five minutes after Julia&rsquo;s exit; and though she made
      the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and displeased in no
      common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his looks only
      expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate and
      stood there, without seeming to know what to do.
    
    
      &ldquo;They desired me to stay&mdash;my cousin Maria charged me to say that you
      would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not believe I shall go any farther,&rdquo; said he sullenly; &ldquo;I see
      nothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere
      else. I have had walking enough.&rdquo;
     
    
      And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it is very unlucky.&rdquo; And she longed to be
      able to say something more to the purpose.
    
    
      After an interval of silence, &ldquo;I think they might as well have staid for
      me,&rdquo; said he.
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.&rdquo;
     
    
      This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause, he
      went on&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.
      Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not think him at all handsome.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is not five
      foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight. I
      think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these Crawfords are no
      addition at all. We did very well without them.&rdquo;
     
    
      A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict
      him.
    
    
      &ldquo;If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have
      been some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare
      say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you
      know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people
      are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems like
      five.&rdquo;
     
    
      He got up and walked to the gate again, and &ldquo;wished he had had the key
      about him at the time.&rdquo; Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there
      an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another attempt, and
      she said, therefore, &ldquo;It is a pity you should not join them. They expected
      to have a better view of the house from that part of the park, and will be
      thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know, can
      be settled without you.&rdquo;
     
    
      She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a
      companion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you really
      think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing.&rdquo;
       And letting himself out, he walked off without farther ceremony.
    
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so
      long ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search of
      them. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just turned
      up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more
      caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings brought them
      before her. They were just returned into the wilderness from the park, to
      which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very soon after their
      leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the park into the very
      avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last, and
      had been sitting down under one of the trees. This was their history. It
      was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly, and were
      not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny&rsquo;s best consolation was in
      being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much, and that he should
      certainly have come back for her, had she not been tired already; but this
      was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a
      whole hour, when he had talked of only a few minutes, nor to banish the
      sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all
      that time; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and
      depression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house.
    
    
      On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and
      Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the
      wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house.
      Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever
      cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces, she
      had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper, after a
      great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the
      dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt for a
      famous cream cheese; and since Julia&rsquo;s leaving them they had been met by
      the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance, for
      she had set him right as to his grandson&rsquo;s illness, convinced him that it
      was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and he, in return, had shewn
      her all his choicest nursery of plants, and actually presented her with a
      very curious specimen of heath.
    
    
      On this rencontre they all returned to the house together, there to
      lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
      Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
      dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came
      in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
      agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
      object of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking after
      each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to
      Fanny&rsquo;s observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing
      harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration. She
      felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not the only
      dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of each. Mr.
      Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought that he was
      taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any little resentment
      of the other two, and restore general good-humour.
    
    
      Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles&rsquo; drive home
      allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to
      table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came
      to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a few
      pheasants&rsquo; eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made
      abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the way.
      At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, &ldquo;I hope I am not
      to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air in so
      exposed a seat.&rdquo; The request had not been foreseen, but was very
      graciously received, and Julia&rsquo;s day was likely to end almost as well as
      it began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, and
      was a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the one
      preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly better
      pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the
      box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Norris, as they drove through the park. &ldquo;Nothing but pleasure from
      beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt
      Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day&rsquo;s amusement
      you have had!&rdquo;
     
    
      Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, &ldquo;I think you
      have done pretty well yourself, ma&rsquo;am. Your lap seems full of good things,
      and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
      elbow unmercifully.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
      gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in
      my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take
      great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the
      excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs.
      Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as long as I
      could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I knew it was just
      the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitaker is a
      treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed
      at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing
      white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage the other
      parcel and the basket very well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What else have you been spunging?&rdquo; said Maria, half-pleased that
      Sotherton should be so complimented.
    
    
      &ldquo;Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants&rsquo; 
      eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not take a
      denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood I
      lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and so to
      be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first
      spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house
      and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours
      to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as pleasant
      as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris ceased
      speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Their spirits
      were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had afforded
      most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost all.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XI
    
    
      The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss
      Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters
      from Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was much
      pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to think
      of their father in England again within a certain period, which these
      letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.
    
    
      November was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote of it
      with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His
      business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take
      his passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward
      with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.
    
    
      Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a
      husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness
      would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness should
      depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to throw a mist
      over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something
      else. It would hardly be early in November, there were generally
      delays, a bad passage or something; that favouring something
      which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or their
      understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would probably
      be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was three
      months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might happen in
      thirteen weeks.
    
    
      Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that
      his daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have
      found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast
      of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her brother to
      spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; and though
      seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and to have
      vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an
      attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the
      letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as Miss Crawford was
      standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight
      scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford were all
      busy with candles at the pianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning
      round towards the group, and saying, &ldquo;How happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is
      thinking of November.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.
    
    
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s return will be a very interesting event.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
      including so many dangers.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your sister&rsquo;s
      marriage, and your taking orders.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be affronted,&rdquo; said she, laughing, &ldquo;but it does put me in mind of
      some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a
      foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is no sacrifice in the case,&rdquo; replied Edmund, with a serious smile,
      and glancing at the pianoforte again; &ldquo;it is entirely her own doing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than what
      every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being extremely
      happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria&rsquo;s
      marrying.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is fortunate that your inclination and your father&rsquo;s convenience
      should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I
      understand, hereabouts.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Which you suppose has biassed me?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But that I am sure it has not,&rdquo; cried Fanny.
    
    
      &ldquo;Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm
      myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for
      me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There
      was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a
      man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a
      competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have
      been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too
      conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I
      think it was blamelessly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is the same sort of thing,&rdquo; said Fanny, after a short pause, &ldquo;as for
      the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be
      in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that
      they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or
      suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either navy
      or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour:
      heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always
      acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and
      sailors.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
      preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;To be
      justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of
      any provision.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed; absolute
      madness.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to
      take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not
      know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your
      own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank
      highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice
      of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him,
      he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good
      intentions in the choice of his.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to
      the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing
      nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is
      indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of all
      laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take
      the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A clergyman has
      nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish&mdash;read the newspaper, watch
      the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work, and
      the business of his own life is to dine.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common as
      to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I
      suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,
      you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose
      opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that your
      own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can
      have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn
      so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle&rsquo;s
      table.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion is
      general, it is usually correct. Though I have not seen much of the
      domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
      deficiency of information.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
      condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or
      (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps
      knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad, they were
      always wishing away.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
      Antwerp,&rdquo; was a tender apostrophe of Fanny&rsquo;s, very much to the purpose of
      her own feelings if not of the conversation.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,&rdquo; said
      Miss Crawford, &ldquo;that I can hardly suppose&mdash;and since you push me so
      hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing
      what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own
      brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me,
      and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar and
      clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, I
      see him to be an indolent, selfish bon vivant, who must have
      his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the
      convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder, is
      out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and I were
      partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green
      goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to
      stay and bear it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great
      defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;
      and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to
      such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to
      defend Dr. Grant.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;but we need not give up his profession for all that;
      because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have taken a&mdash;not
      a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy or army, have
      had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think
      more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a
      clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to
      wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of
      becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where he would
      have had less time and obligation&mdash;where he might have escaped that
      knowledge of himself, the frequency, at least, of that knowledge
      which it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man&mdash;a
      sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others
      their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach
      such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the
      better for it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that he
      oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been
      anything but a clergyman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
      fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends
      upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a good-humour
      every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green
      geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund
      affectionately, &ldquo;must be beyond the reach of any sermons.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time to
      say, in a pleasant manner, &ldquo;I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
      deserve praise than to hear it&rdquo;; when, being earnestly invited by the Miss
      Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument, leaving
      Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many
      virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.
    
    
      &ldquo;There goes good-humour, I am sure,&rdquo; said he presently. &ldquo;There goes a
      temper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily
      she falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she
      is asked. What a pity,&rdquo; he added, after an instant&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;that she
      should have been in such hands!&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the
      window with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes
      soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was
      solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an
      unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny
      spoke her feelings. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s harmony!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s repose! Here&rsquo;s
      what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can
      attempt to describe! Here&rsquo;s what may tranquillise every care, and lift the
      heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if
      there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world; and there
      certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more
      attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by
      contemplating such a scene.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are
      much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you
      do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.
      They lose a great deal.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had a very apt scholar. There&rsquo;s Arcturus looking very bright.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; I do not know how it has happened.&rdquo; The glee began. &ldquo;We will stay
      till this is finished, Fanny,&rdquo; said he, turning his back on the window;
      and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,
      moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it
      ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting
      to hear the glee again.
    
    
      Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s
      threats of catching cold.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XII
    
    
      Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to
      call him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.
      Bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to
      Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay, agreeable,
      and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford demanded; to tell
      of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to which she might have
      listened six weeks before with some interest, and altogether to give her
      the fullest conviction, by the power of actual comparison, of her
      preferring his younger brother.
    
    
      It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;
      and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want to
      attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required:
      his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but pleasure in
      view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear that he did not
      care about her; and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her
      own, that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park, the Sir
      Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did not believe she could
      accept him.
    
    
      The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took Mr.
      Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in the
      beginning of September. He went for a fortnight&mdash;a fortnight of such
      dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their
      guard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the
      absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not to
      return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of
      shooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to
      keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own
      motives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was
      tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example, he
      would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome, clever,
      and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; and finding nothing
      in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield, he gladly returned
      to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by
      those whom he came to trifle with further.
    
    
      Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the
      repeated details of his day&rsquo;s sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,
      his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications, and
      his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to female
      feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other,
      had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged and unemployed,
      felt all the right of missing him much more. Each sister believed herself
      the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints of Mrs.
      Grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr.
      Crawford himself. Everything returned into the same channel as before his
      absence; his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no
      ground with either, and just stopping short of the consistence, the
      steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general
      notice.
    
    
      Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but
      since the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with either
      sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and had
      her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in
      every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly, and
      judging candidly, she would probably have made some important
      communications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she only
      hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. &ldquo;I am rather surprised,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here so
      long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was so very fond of
      change and moving about, that I thought something would certainly occur,
      when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He is used to much gayer
      places than Mansfield.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is to his credit,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s answer; &ldquo;and I dare say it gives his
      sister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What a favourite he is with my cousins!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I believe,
      suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much symptom of
      it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a serious
      attachment would remove.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If Miss Bertram were not engaged,&rdquo; said Fanny cautiously, &ldquo;I could
      sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,
      Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before he
      has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate
      friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself.
      Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger
      from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof as she
      has given that her feelings are not strong.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think differently
      in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do, and all the
      help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in
      some of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s
      choice, she knew not always what to think. She was privy, one evening, to
      the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject, as well as to her feelings,
      and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a point of some similarity, and
      could not help wondering as she listened; and glad would she have been not
      to be obliged to listen, for it was while all the other young people were
      dancing, and she sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the
      fire, longing for the re-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own
      hopes of a partner then depended. It was Fanny&rsquo;s first ball, though
      without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady&rsquo;s first ball,
      being the thought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of
      a violin player in the servants&rsquo; hall, and the possibility of raising five
      couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr.
      Bertram&rsquo;s just arrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one
      to Fanny through four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even
      a quarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now at the
      dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two above-mentioned
      ladies was forced on her&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;I think, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.
      Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, &ldquo;we shall see
      some happy faces again now.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, indeed,&rdquo; replied the other, with a stately simper, &ldquo;there
      will be some satisfaction in looking on now, and I think it was
      rather a pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their
      situation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my
      son did not propose it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say he did, ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria
      has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy which
      one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth&mdash;that wish of avoiding
      particularity! Dear ma&rsquo;am, only look at her face at this moment; how
      different from what it was the two last dances!&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with pleasure,
      and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr.
      Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster together. How she
      had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she had been dancing
      with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.
    
    
      Mrs. Norris continued, &ldquo;It is quite delightful, ma&rsquo;am, to see young people
      so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I cannot but
      think of dear Sir Thomas&rsquo;s delight. And what do you say, ma&rsquo;am, to the
      chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example, and such
      things are very catching.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.
    
    
      &ldquo;The couple above, ma&rsquo;am. Do you see no symptoms there?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.
      What is his property?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Four thousand a year.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have.
      Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very genteel,
      steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is not a settled thing, ma&rsquo;am, yet. We only speak of it among friends.
      But I have very little doubt it will be. He is growing extremely
      particular in his attentions.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all suspended
      for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though feeling it
      would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it must happen. He
      came towards their little circle; but instead of asking her to dance, drew
      a chair near her, and gave her an account of the present state of a sick
      horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom he had just parted. Fanny
      found that it was not to be, and in the modesty of her nature immediately
      felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it. When he had told of
      his horse, he took a newspaper from the table, and looking over it, said
      in a languid way, &ldquo;If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.&rdquo;
       With more than equal civility the offer was declined; she did not wish to
      dance. &ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing
      down the newspaper again, &ldquo;for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the
      good people can keep it up so long. They had need be all in love,
      to find any amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look
      at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers&mdash;all but Yates
      and Mrs. Grant&mdash;and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a
      lover as much as any one of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with
      the doctor,&rdquo; making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the
      latter, who proving, however, to be close at his elbow, made so
      instantaneous a change of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in
      spite of everything, could hardly help laughing at. &ldquo;A strange business
      this in America, Dr. Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to
      know what I am to think of public matters.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear Tom,&rdquo; cried his aunt soon afterwards, &ldquo;as you are not dancing, I
      dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall you?&rdquo;
       Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal, added in
      a whisper, &ldquo;We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you know. Your
      mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare time to sit
      down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will
      just do; and though we play but half-crowns, you know, you may bet
      half-guineas with him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should be most happy,&rdquo; replied he aloud, and jumping up with alacrity,
      &ldquo;it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am this moment going
      to dance.&rdquo; Come, Fanny, taking her hand, &ldquo;do not be dawdling any longer,
      or the dance will be over.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to feel
      much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly did,
      between the selfishness of another person and his own.
    
    
      &ldquo;A pretty modest request upon my word,&rdquo; he indignantly exclaimed as they
      walked away. &ldquo;To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours
      with herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking
      old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good aunt
      would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too! without
      ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility of refusing.
      That is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my spleen more
      than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of being given a
      choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to
      do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily thought of
      standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is a great deal
      too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head, nothing can stop
      her.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIII
    
    
      The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend him
      beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of a lord
      with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought
      his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr. Bertram&rsquo;s
      acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had spent ten days
      together in the same society, and the friendship, if friendship it might
      be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates&rsquo;s being invited to
      take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could, and by his promising to
      come; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected, in
      consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party assembled for
      gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join.
      He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head full of acting,
      for it had been a theatrical party; and the play in which he had borne a
      part was within two days of representation, when the sudden death of one
      of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and
      dispersed the performers. To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near
      the long paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford, the
      seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course
      have immortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so
      near, to lose it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could
      talk of nothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements
      and dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to
      boast of the past his only consolation.
    
    
      Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting
      so strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest
      of his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it was
      all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a party
      concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play had been
      Lovers&rsquo; Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. &ldquo;A trifling
      part,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and not at all to my taste, and such a one as I certainly
      would not accept again; but I was determined to make no difficulties. Lord
      Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth
      playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to
      resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for
      him that he should have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more
      equal to the Baron&mdash;a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse
      after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the piece materially;
      but I was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir Henry thought the
      duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because Sir Henry wanted the
      part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two. I was
      surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength of the piece
      did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was
      thought very great by many. And upon the whole, it would certainly have
      gone off wonderfully.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It was a hard case, upon my word&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;I do think you were very much to
      be pitied,&rdquo; were the kind responses of listening sympathy.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager
      could not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help wishing
      that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we
      wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all
      happening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great
      harm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is
      one of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;An afterpiece instead of a comedy,&rdquo; said Mr. Bertram. &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows were
      at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by
      themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort him; and perhaps,
      between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the
      Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make you amends,
      Yates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to
      be our manager.&rdquo;
     
    
      This, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for
      the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in
      him who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as to
      make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of
      lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty of
      acting. The thought returned again and again. &ldquo;Oh for the Ecclesford
      theatre and scenery to try something with.&rdquo; Each sister could echo the
      wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications
      it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. &ldquo;I really
      believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any
      character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the
      singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I
      could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or
      cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language. Let us be
      doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what should
      prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,&rdquo; looking towards the Miss
      Bertrams; &ldquo;and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We shall be only
      amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We must have a curtain,&rdquo; said Tom Bertram; &ldquo;a few yards of green baize
      for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, quite enough,&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates, &ldquo;with only just a side wing or two
      run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing
      more would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among
      ourselves we should want nothing more.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe we must be satisfied with less,&rdquo; said Maria. &ldquo;There
      would not be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather
      adopt Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s views, and make the performance, not the theatre,
      our object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. &ldquo;Let us do nothing by
      halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with
      pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from beginning to
      end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking,
      shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a song
      between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;Nobody loves a play
      better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly
      walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who
      have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have
      all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.&rdquo;
     
    
      After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was
      discussed with unabated eagerness, every one&rsquo;s inclination increasing by
      the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and though
      nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his
      sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could
      be easier than to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution
      to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite
      uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, if possible, though his
      mother, who equally heard the conversation which passed at table, did not
      evince the least disapprobation.
    
    
      The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.
      Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.
      Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was standing
      thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little
      distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus began as he
      entered&mdash;&ldquo;Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not to be
      met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I think,
      I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one good
      thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,
      precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther end,
      communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five minutes,
      by merely moving the bookcase in my father&rsquo;s room, is the very thing we
      could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and my father&rsquo;s
      room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the billiard-room on
      purpose.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?&rdquo; said Edmund, in a low
      voice, as his brother approached the fire.
    
    
      &ldquo;Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you
      in it?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think it would be very wrong. In a general light, private
      theatricals are open to some objections, but as we are
      circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than
      injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of
      feeling on my father&rsquo;s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of
      constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria,
      whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely
      delicate.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three times
      a week till my father&rsquo;s return, and invite all the country. But it is not
      to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little amusement among
      ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something
      new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in
      chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no
      greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written
      language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our
      own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father&rsquo;s being absent,
      it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for
      the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother;
      and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her
      spirits for the next few weeks, I shall think our time very well spent,
      and so, I am sure, will he. It is a very anxious period for her.&rdquo;
     
    
      As he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk back
      in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease, and
      tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was getting
      through the few difficulties of her work for her.
    
    
      Edmund smiled and shook his head.
    
    
      &ldquo;By Jove! this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with a
      hearty laugh. &ldquo;To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety&mdash;I was
      unlucky there.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one
      half-roused; &ldquo;I was not asleep.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no, ma&rsquo;am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,&rdquo; he continued,
      returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady
      Bertram began to nod again, &ldquo;but this I will maintain, that
      we shall be doing no harm.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally
      disapprove it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise of
      talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for
      anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a
      decided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time
      have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to be&rsquo;d
      and not to be&rsquo;d, in this very room, for his amusement? And I
      am sure, my name was Norval, every evening of
      my life through one Christmas holidays.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My
      father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never wish
      his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is
      strict.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said Tom, displeased. &ldquo;I know my father as well as you
      do; and I&rsquo;ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him.
      Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest of the
      family.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you are resolved on acting,&rdquo; replied the persevering Edmund, &ldquo;I must
      hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre ought
      not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father&rsquo;s house
      in his absence which could not be justified.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;For everything of that nature I will be answerable,&rdquo; said Tom, in a
      decided tone. &ldquo;His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an
      interest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such
      alterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or
      unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a
      week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose he
      would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the
      breakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister&rsquo;s
      pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an
      expense.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps it
      might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have
      undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a
      little carpenter&rsquo;s work, and that&rsquo;s all; and as the carpenter&rsquo;s work may
      be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd
      to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed, everything will be
      right with Sir Thomas. Don&rsquo;t imagine that nobody in this house can see or
      judge but yourself. Don&rsquo;t act yourself, if you do not like it, but don&rsquo;t
      expect to govern everybody else.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, as to acting myself,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;that I absolutely protest
      against.&rdquo;
     
    
      Tom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit down
      and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.
    
    
      Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling
      throughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest some
      comfort, &ldquo;Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them. Your
      brother&rsquo;s taste and your sisters&rsquo; seem very different.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will
      find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them,
      and that is all I can do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my
      sisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself, I
      shall let things take their course, without attempting it through her.
      Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do
      anything than be altogether by the ears.&rdquo;
     
    
      His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,
      were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his
      representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.
      Their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the least
      afraid of their father&rsquo;s disapprobation. There could be no harm in what
      had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women of the
      first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that could see
      anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only brothers and
      sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be heard of beyond
      themselves. Julia did seem inclined to admit that Maria&rsquo;s situation
      might require particular caution and delicacy&mdash;but that could not
      extend to her&mdash;she was at liberty; and Maria evidently
      considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above
      restraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either
      father or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the
      subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,
      calling out, &ldquo;No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want of
      understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted into
      the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame
      confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.&rdquo;
     
    
      Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, &ldquo;What say you now? Can we be
      wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?&rdquo; And Edmund, silenced, was obliged
      to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to
      the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more on the
      obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on anything else.
    
    
      The scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he was
      mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started no
      difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest
      nephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole
      arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all
      to herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle, and
      importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself
      obliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at her
      own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be spent
      in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the
      project.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XIV
    
    
      Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business of
      finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and the
      carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had
      suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made
      the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was
      already at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations were
      also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from
      Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good
      management of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming
      into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and as
      two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope
      that none might ever be found.
    
    
      There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people to
      be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a need
      that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there did
      seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal
      could hold out.
    
    
      On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates;
      on the comic, Tom Bertram, not quite alone, because it was evident
      that Mary Crawford&rsquo;s wishes, though politely kept back, inclined the same
      way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to make allies
      unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable difference,
      they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the whole, but every
      character first-rate, and three principal women. All the best plays were
      run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor Othello, nor Douglas,
      nor The Gamester, presented anything that could satisfy even the
      tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal, Wheel of Fortune, Heir
      at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively dismissed with yet warmer
      objections. No piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody with a
      difficulty, and on one side or the other it was a continual repetition of,
      &ldquo;Oh no, that will never do! Let us have no ranting tragedies. Too
      many characters. Not a tolerable woman&rsquo;s part in the play. Anything but that,
      my dear Tom. It would be impossible to fill it up. One could not expect
      anybody to take such a part. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end.
      That might do, perhaps, but for the low parts. If I must
      give my opinion, I have always thought it the most insipid play in the
      English language. I do not wish to make objections; I shall be
      happy to be of any use, but I think we could not chuse worse.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness
      which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering
      how it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished that
      something might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but
      everything of higher consequence was against it.
    
    
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said Tom Bertram at last. &ldquo;We are wasting time most
      abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that something
      is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many must not
      frighten us. We must double them. We must descend a little. If a
      part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of it.
      From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse to give
      me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more.&rdquo;
     
    
      For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting only
      whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and very
      earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that
      there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.
    
    
      The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same
      speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the
      table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows! And
      why should not Lovers&rsquo; Vows do for us as well as for the
      Ravenshaws? How came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if
      it would do exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts
      for Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody
      else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not
      dislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my
      best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only
      Count Cassel and Anhalt.&rdquo;
     
    
      The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of
      indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been
      proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularly
      pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,
      had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw&rsquo;s, and been forced to re-rant it
      all in his own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the height of
      his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes
      by heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity, offer his
      services for the part. To do him justice, however, he did not resolve to
      appropriate it; for remembering that there was some very good
      ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed an equal willingness for that.
      Henry Crawford was ready to take either. Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse
      would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parley of compliment ensued. Miss
      Bertram, feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question, took on
      her to decide it, by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which
      height and figure ought to be considered, and that his being the
      tallest, seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged
      to be quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was
      certain of the proper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast,
      besides Mr. Rushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to
      do anything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to
      be scrupulous on Miss Crawford&rsquo;s account.
    
    
      &ldquo;This is not behaving well by the absent,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Here are not women
      enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing for
      your sister, Mr. Crawford.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Crawford desired that might not be thought of: he was very sure
      his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that she
      would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But this was
      immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of Amelia to be
      in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.
      &ldquo;It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as Agatha does
      to one or other of my sisters. It can be no sacrifice on their side, for
      it is highly comic.&rdquo;
     
    
      A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the
      best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the
      rest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with
      seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the
      business.
    
    
      &ldquo;I must entreat Miss Julia Bertram,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not to engage in the
      part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must not,
      indeed you must not&rdquo; (turning to her). &ldquo;I could not stand your countenance
      dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had together would
      infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged
      to run away.&rdquo;
     
    
      Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the
      matter to Julia&rsquo;s feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the
      injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Maria was
      preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed
      how well it was understood; and before Julia could command herself enough
      to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too, by saying, &ldquo;Oh yes!
      Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha. Though Julia fancies
      she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it. There is nothing of
      tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her features are not tragic
      features, and she walks too quick, and speaks too quick, and would not
      keep her countenance. She had better do the old countrywoman: the
      Cottager&rsquo;s wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager&rsquo;s wife is a very pretty
      part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of
      her husband with a good deal of spirit. You shall be Cottager&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Cottager&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates. &ldquo;What are you talking of? The most
      trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a
      tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult to
      propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We all agreed
      that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more justice, Mr.
      Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if you cannot
      appreciate the talents of your company a little better.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, as to that, my good friend, till I and my company have really
      acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to Julia.
      We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager&rsquo;s wife; and I am
      sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with
      the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have more credit in
      making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent against
      everything humorous, let her take Cottager&rsquo;s speeches instead of
      Cottager&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s, and so change the parts all through; he is
      solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the
      play, and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife&rsquo;s speeches, I
      would undertake him with all my heart.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With all your partiality for Cottager&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Henry Crawford, &ldquo;it
      will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we must
      not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not allow her
      to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance. Her
      talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more difficult to
      be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia is the most
      difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great powers, great
      nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance. I
      have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond
      the reach of almost every actress by profession. It requires a delicacy of
      feeling which they have not. It requires a gentlewoman&mdash;a Julia
      Bertram. You will undertake it, I hope?&rdquo; turning to her with a look
      of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but while she hesitated
      what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss Crawford&rsquo;s better
      claim.
    
    
      &ldquo;No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her. She
      would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and robust.
      Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is fit for
      Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and I am
      persuaded will do it admirably.&rdquo;
     
    
      Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication. &ldquo;You
      must oblige us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;indeed you must. When you have studied the
      character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your
      choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you. You
      will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not
      refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your
      basket.&rdquo;
     
    
      The influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he only trying
      to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous affront? She
      distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. He was, perhaps, but
      at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously at her sister;
      Maria&rsquo;s countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed and alarmed&mdash;but
      Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on
      this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense. With hasty
      indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she said to him, &ldquo;You do
      not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a
      basket of provisions&mdash;though one might have supposed&mdash;but it is
      only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!&rdquo; She stopped&mdash;Henry
      Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not know what to say. Tom
      Bertram began again&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid of my wanting the character,&rdquo; cried Julia, with
      angry quickness: &ldquo;I am not to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do
      nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the most
      disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert, unnatural,
      impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and this is comedy
      in its worst form.&rdquo; And so saying, she walked hastily out of the room,
      leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting small compassion
      in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole, and who
      could not think of her as under the agitations of jealousy without
      great pity.
    
    
      A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon returned
      to business and Lovers&rsquo; Vows, and was eagerly looking over the play, with
      Mr. Yates&rsquo;s help, to ascertain what scenery would be necessary&mdash;while
      Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under-voice, and the
      declaration with which she began of, &ldquo;I am sure I would give up the part
      to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall probably do it very ill,
      I feel persuaded she would do it worse,&rdquo; was doubtless receiving
      all the compliments it called for.
    
    
      When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed by
      Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in the
      room now beginning to be called the Theatre, and Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of
      Amelia to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.
    
    
      The first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which had
      been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play of
      which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran
      through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of
      astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it
      could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Amelia
      appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home
      representation&mdash;the situation of one, and the language of the other,
      so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly
      suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and
      longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which
      Edmund would certainly make.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XV
    
    
      Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another
      character was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel and
      Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss Bertram
      to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different style of
      the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he had once
      seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow, he
      soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the decision, for the
      less he had to learn the better; and though she could not sympathise in
      his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together, nor wait very
      patiently while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope of
      still discovering such a scene, she very kindly took his part in hand, and
      curtailed every speech that admitted being shortened; besides pointing out
      the necessity of his being very much dressed, and chusing his colours. Mr.
      Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well, though affecting to
      despise it; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be
      to think of the others, or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of
      that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for.
    
    
      Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,
      knew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room before
      dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates;
      and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the
      agreeable news.
    
    
      &ldquo;We have got a play,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is to be Lovers&rsquo; Vows; and I am to be
      Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin
      cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a
      shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard this
      speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.
    
    
      &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows!&rdquo; in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply to
      Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly
      doubting a contradiction.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates. &ldquo;After all our debatings and difficulties, we find
      there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so
      unexceptionable, as Lovers&rsquo; Vows. The wonder is that it should not have
      been thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have all
      the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to have
      anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But what do you do for women?&rdquo; said Edmund gravely, and looking at Maria.
    
    
      Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, &ldquo;I take the part which
      Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and&rdquo; (with a bolder eye) &ldquo;Miss Crawford
      is to be Amelia.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up,
      with us,&rdquo; replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his
      mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great
      vexation.
    
    
      Mr. Rushworth followed him to say, &ldquo;I come in three times, and have
      two-and-forty speeches. That&rsquo;s something, is not it? But I do not much
      like the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress
      and a pink satin cloak.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out
      of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being accompanied
      by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth, Edmund almost
      immediately took the opportunity of saying, &ldquo;I cannot, before Mr. Yates,
      speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at
      Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell you, that I think
      it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I hope you will
      give it up. I cannot but suppose you will when you have read it
      carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or
      aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary to send you
      to your father&rsquo;s judgment, I am convinced.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We see things very differently,&rdquo; cried Maria. &ldquo;I am perfectly acquainted
      with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions, and so forth,
      which will be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it; and
      I am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very
      fit for private representation.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; was his answer; &ldquo;but in this matter it is you
      who are to lead. You must set the example. If others have
      blundered, it is your place to put them right, and shew them what true
      delicacy is. In all points of decorum your conduct must be law to
      the rest of the party.&rdquo;
     
    
      This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better
      to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, &ldquo;I am much
      obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still think
      you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to harangue all
      the rest upon a subject of this kind. There would be the greatest
      indecorum, I think.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your
      conduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel
      yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and
      confidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and
      it will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your
      motive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it
      ought.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do not act anything improper, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram. &ldquo;Sir Thomas
      would not like it.&mdash;Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.&mdash;To
      be sure, Julia is dressed by this time.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am convinced, madam,&rdquo; said Edmund, preventing Fanny, &ldquo;that Sir Thomas
      would not like it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If I were to decline the part,&rdquo; said Maria, with renewed zeal, &ldquo;Julia
      would certainly take it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Edmund, &ldquo;if she knew your reasons!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! she might think the difference between us&mdash;the difference in our
      situations&mdash;that she need not be so scrupulous as I
      might feel necessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse
      me; I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be
      so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we
      shall never act anything.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I was just going to say the very same thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;If every
      play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the preparations will
      be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure that would be a
      discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria says, if there
      is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of them) it can be
      easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As Mr. Rushworth is
      to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had known his own mind
      when the carpenters began, for there was the loss of half a day&rsquo;s work
      about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good job, however. The maids
      do their work very well, and I think we shall be able to send back some
      dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put them so very close
      together. I am of some use, I hope, in preventing waste and making
      the most of things. There should always be one steady head to superintend
      so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me
      this very day. I had been looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was
      just coming out, when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the
      servants&rsquo; hall-door with two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them
      to father, you may be sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to
      father, and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for
      he could not no how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the
      servants&rsquo; dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and
      as I hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I
      have always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said
      to the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,
      who ought to be ashamed of himself), &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take the boards to your
      father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.&rsquo; The boy looked
      very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might
      speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding
      about the house for one while. I hate such greediness&mdash;so good as
      your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!&rdquo;
     
    
      Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and
      Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only
      satisfaction.
    
    
      Dinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick
      Jackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of,
      for Edmund&rsquo;s disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he would
      not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford&rsquo;s animating support,
      thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying to make
      himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic
      than that of his regret at her secession from their company; and Mr.
      Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his head, had
      soon talked away all that could be said of either.
    
    
      But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:
      there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening
      giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being
      reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a
      separate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting deep
      in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance
      of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it was, could
      not help coming, and were received with the most grateful joy.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, how do you go on?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What have you settled?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh! we can do
      nothing without you,&rdquo; followed the first salutations; and Henry Crawford
      was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his sister made
      her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was complimenting her.
      &ldquo;I must really congratulate your ladyship,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;on the play being
      chosen; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am sure
      you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties. The actors may be
      glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision;
      and I do sincerely give you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and
      everybody else who is in the same predicament,&rdquo; glancing half fearfully,
      half slyly, beyond Fanny to Edmund.
    
    
      She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.
      His being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat
      with the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned to the
      party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to interest herself in
      their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden recollection, she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon these
      cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let me know my fate in
      the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman among you am I to have
      the pleasure of making love to?&rdquo;
     
    
      For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same
      melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth was
      to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had my choice of the parts,&rdquo; said Mr. Rushworth; &ldquo;but I thought I
      should like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am to
      have.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You chose very wisely, I am sure,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford, with a
      brightened look; &ldquo;Anhalt is a heavy part.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The Count has two-and-forty speeches,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Rushworth, &ldquo;which is no trifle.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprised,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, after a short pause, &ldquo;at
      this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward young
      lady may well frighten the men.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,&rdquo; cried
      Tom; &ldquo;but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I will not
      entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done&mdash;I will
      look it over again.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Your brother should take the part,&rdquo; said Mr. Yates, in a low
      voice. &ldquo;Do not you think he would?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall not ask him,&rdquo; replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.
    
    
      Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the
      party at the fire.
    
    
      &ldquo;They do not want me at all,&rdquo; said she, seating herself. &ldquo;I only puzzle
      them, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as you
      do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and, therefore,
      I apply to you. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it practicable
      for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;is that you change the play.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should have no objection,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;for though I should not
      particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if
      everything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they
      do not chuse to hear your advice at that table&rdquo; (looking
      round), &ldquo;it certainly will not be taken.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund said no more.
    
    
      &ldquo;If any part could tempt you to act, I suppose it would be
      Anhalt,&rdquo; observed the lady archly, after a short pause; &ldquo;for he is a
      clergyman, you know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That circumstance would by no means tempt me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for I
      should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It must be
      very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer;
      and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one of the last
      who would wish to represent it on the stage.&rdquo;
     
    
      Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and
      mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and gave
      all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.
    
    
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conference was
      eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, &ldquo;we want your
      services.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of
      employing her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that
      Edmund could do.
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your present
      services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be Cottager&rsquo;s
      wife.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look. &ldquo;Indeed
      you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give me the
      world. No, indeed, I cannot act.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten you:
      it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen speeches
      altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say;
      so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you to look
      at.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,&rdquo; cried Mr. Rushworth, &ldquo;what
      would you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,&rdquo; said Fanny, shocked to
      find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel that
      almost every eye was upon her; &ldquo;but I really cannot act.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you can act well enough for us. Learn your part, and we
      will teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall be
      Cottager, I&rsquo;ll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very
      well, I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea. It
      would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I should
      only disappoint you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You&rsquo;ll do it very well. Every
      allowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must get
      a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make you a few
      wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes, and
      you will be a very proper, little old woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,&rdquo; cried Fanny, growing more
      and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully at
      Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate his
      brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. Her entreaty
      had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said before; and it
      was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed by Maria, and Mr.
      Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed from his but in
      being more gentle or more ceremonious, and which altogether was quite
      overpowering to Fanny; and before she could breathe after it, Mrs. Norris
      completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and
      audible&mdash;&ldquo;What a piece of work here is about nothing: I am quite
      ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins
      in a trifle of this sort&mdash;so kind as they are to you! Take the part
      with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do not urge her, madam,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;It is not fair to urge her in this
      manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for herself, as
      well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted. Do
      not urge her any more.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am not going to urge her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Norris sharply; &ldquo;but I shall
      think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her
      aunt and cousins wish her&mdash;very ungrateful, indeed, considering who
      and what she is.&rdquo;
     
    
      Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment
      with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were
      beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, &ldquo;I do
      not like my situation: this place is too hot for me,&rdquo; and moved
      away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying
      to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, &ldquo;Never mind, my
      dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and teasing,
      but do not let us mind them&rdquo;; and with pointed attention continued to talk
      to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of being out of
      spirits herself. By a look at her brother she prevented any farther
      entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which
      she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the
      little she had lost in Edmund&rsquo;s favour.
    
    
      Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her
      for her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and
      wishing she could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and
      supposing Fanny was now preparing for her appearance, as of course
      she would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to
      inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that she
      had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young man,
      and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again&mdash;she
      could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or help
      listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.
    
    
      The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram&rsquo;s telling her, with
      infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to
      undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been most
      anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do; he
      must give it up. &ldquo;But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling
      it,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse. I
      could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six miles of us,
      who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are one or two
      that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trust either of the
      Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow, and Charles
      Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere, so I will take
      my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over to Stoke, and settle with
      one of them.&rdquo;
     
    
      While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full
      expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:
      so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.
      After a moment&rsquo;s thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, &ldquo;As far as I am
      concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think
      eligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. Charles
      Maddox dined at my sister&rsquo;s one day, did not he, Henry? A quiet-looking
      young man. I remember him. Let him be applied to, if you please,
      for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.&rdquo;
     
    
      Charles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his resolution of going to
      him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened her
      lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance first at
      Maria and then at Edmund, that &ldquo;the Mansfield theatricals would enliven
      the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,&rdquo; Edmund still held his peace, and
      shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.
    
    
      &ldquo;I am not very sanguine as to our play,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, in an
      undervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; &ldquo;and I can tell Mr. Maddox
      that I shall shorten some of his speeches, and a great many of my
      own, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable, and
      by no means what I expected.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVI
    
    
      It was not in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s power to talk Fanny into any real
      forgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went to
      bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack
      from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spirits
      sinking under her aunt&rsquo;s unkind reflection and reproach. To be called into
      notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to something
      so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do what was so impossible as
      to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow
      it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation, had been
      too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone
      much less so, especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow
      might produce in continuation of the subject. Miss Crawford had protected
      her only for the time; and if she were applied to again among themselves
      with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and
      Edmund perhaps away, what should she do? She fell asleep before she could
      answer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the
      next morning. The little white attic, which had continued her
      sleeping-room ever since her first entering the family, proving
      incompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was
      dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking
      about in and thinking, and of which she had now for some time been almost
      equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till the Miss
      Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as
      such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read
      and written, and talked and laughed, till within the last three years,
      when she had quitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some
      time was quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or
      wanted one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the
      deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: but
      gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added to
      her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing to
      oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that
      it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been
      called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny&rsquo;s,
      almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making
      the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams, with
      every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of
      superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,
      having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny&rsquo;s account,
      was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted,
      though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to
      imply that it was the best room in the house.
    
    
      The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable in
      many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind as
      Fanny&rsquo;s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be
      driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in her
      hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything unpleasant
      below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or some train of
      thought at hand. Her plants, her books&mdash;of which she had been a
      collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling&mdash;her
      writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her
      reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would do,
      she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an interesting
      remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or bore her
      thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much of
      suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her
      feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she had
      known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every
      recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt Bertram
      had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet
      more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend:
      he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not
      to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears
      delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by
      distance, that every former affliction had its charm. The room was most
      dear to her, and she would not have changed its furniture for the
      handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plain had
      suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies and
      ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia&rsquo;s work, too ill done for the
      drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for transparencies, for
      the three lower panes of one window, where Tintern Abbey held its station
      between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection
      of family profiles, thought unworthy of being anywhere else, over the
      mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned against the wall, a small
      sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William,
      with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast.
    
    
      To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on an
      agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund&rsquo;s profile she
      could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums she
      might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more than
      fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel undecided
      as to what she ought to do; and as she walked round
      the room her doubts were increasing. Was she right in refusing what
      was so warmly asked, so strongly wished for&mdash;what might be so
      essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest
      complaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and
      a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund&rsquo;s judgment, would his
      persuasion of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to
      justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would be
      so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and
      purity of her own scruples; and as she looked around her, the claims of
      her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present
      upon present that she had received from them. The table between the
      windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given
      her at different times, principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to
      the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap
      at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her
      duty, and her gentle &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; was answered by the appearance of one,
      before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened at
      the sight of Edmund.
    
    
      &ldquo;Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?&rdquo; said he.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I want to consult. I want your opinion.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My opinion!&rdquo; she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it
      gratified her.
    
    
      &ldquo;Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting
      scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a
      play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
      the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end
      of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know
      no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring
      from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable,
      the more than intimacy&mdash;the familiarity. I cannot think of it
      with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as
      must, if possible, be prevented. Do not you see it in the
      same light?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is but one thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt
      myself. I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.&rdquo;
     
    
      Fanny could not answer him.
    
    
      &ldquo;It is not at all what I like,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;No man can like being
      driven into the appearance of such inconsistency. After being known
      to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of
      my joining them now, when they are exceeding their first plan in
      every respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fanny slowly, &ldquo;not immediately, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.
      Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that may,
      of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man&rsquo;s being
      received in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all
      hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints.
      To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. It
      is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s place, Fanny. Consider
      what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be felt
      for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard enough of what she
      said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a
      stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with different
      expectations&mdash;perhaps without considering the subject enough to know
      what was likely to be&mdash;it would be ungenerous, it would be really
      wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings ought to be respected. Does it not
      strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to
      do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think will be
      disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the others!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I
      act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.
      But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business, of
      limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well
      repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have
      offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in
      good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading them
      to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are
      now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My object is to
      confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this be worth
      gaining?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be a great point.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other measure
      by which I have a chance of doing equal good?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I cannot think of anything else.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh, cousin!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet&mdash;But it
      is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the
      country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act&mdash;no matter
      whom: the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought you would
      have entered more into Miss Crawford&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her,&rdquo; said
      Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.
    
    
      &ldquo;She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night.
      It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She was very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared&rdquo;...
    
    
      She could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her in
      the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.
    
    
      &ldquo;I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and am sure of
      giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any
      longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had spoken
      to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has been full
      of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly making it less
      than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it
      over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good-humour at
      the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity. You,
      in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into China, I suppose. How does
      Lord Macartney go on?&rdquo;&mdash;opening a volume on the table and then taking
      up some others. &ldquo;And here are Crabbe&rsquo;s Tales, and the Idler, at hand to
      relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I admire your little
      establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am gone, you will empty your
      head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your
      table. But do not stay here to be cold.&rdquo;
     
    
      He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He
      had told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most
      unwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. To be acting! After
      all his objections&mdash;objections so just and so public! After all that
      she had heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling.
      Could it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving
      himself? Was he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford&rsquo;s doing. She had
      seen her influence in every speech, and was miserable. The doubts and
      alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, and
      which had all slept while she listened to him, were become of little
      consequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them up. Things should take
      their course; she cared not how it ended. Her cousins might attack, but
      could hardly tease her. She was beyond their reach; and if at last obliged
      to yield&mdash;no matter&mdash;it was all misery now.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER XVII
    
    
      It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a victory
      over Edmund&rsquo;s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was most
      delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling
      project, and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous
      weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee of
      feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and say he
      did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in
      particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven to it
      by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended from that
      moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were both as much
      the better as the happier for the descent.
    
    
      They behaved very well, however, to him on the occasion, betraying
      no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed
      to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles
      Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their
      inclination. &ldquo;To have it quite in their own family circle was what they
      had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the
      destruction of all their comfort&rdquo;; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,
      gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were
      ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was all
      good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress,
      Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt&rsquo;s last scene with the Baron admitted a
      good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his
      speeches.
    
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now. Perhaps
      you may persuade her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! very well.&rdquo; And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself
      again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail
      her already.
    
    
      There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this
      change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered
      with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair
      as could have but one effect on him. &ldquo;He was certainly right in respecting
      such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it.&rdquo; And the morning wore
      away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One advantage
      resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss Crawford, Mrs.
      Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to undertake the part for
      which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all that occurred to gladden her
      heart during the day; and even this, when imparted by Edmund, brought a
      pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged&mdash;it
      was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude, and
      whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration. She
      was safe; but peace and safety were unconnected here. Her mind had been
      never farther from peace. She could not feel that she had done wrong
      herself, but she was disquieted in every other way. Her heart and her
      judgment were equally against Edmund&rsquo;s decision: she could not acquit his
      unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made her wretched. She was full
      of jealousy and agitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which
      seemed an insult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she
      could hardly answer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy,
      prosperous and important; each had their object of interest, their part,
      their dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all
      were finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in
      the playful conceits they suggested. She alone was sad and insignificant:
      she had no share in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the
      midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room,
      without being seen or missed. She could almost think anything would have
      been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant was of consequence: her
      good-nature had honourable mention; her taste and her time were
      considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended, and
      praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the
      character she had accepted. But reflection brought better feelings, and
      shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never have
      belonged to her; and that, had she received even the greatest, she
      could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, considering only her
      uncle, she must condemn altogether.
    
    
      Fanny&rsquo;s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as
      she soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too, though
      not quite so blamelessly.
    
    
      Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long
      allowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister so
      reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the conviction
      of his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she submitted to it
      without any alarm for Maria&rsquo;s situation, or any endeavour at rational
      tranquillity for herself. She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in such
      gravity as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse; or
      allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaiety to
      him alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.
    
    
      For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had
      endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment,
      but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses;
      and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one
      flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather thought it a
      lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have
      raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She was not pleased to see
      Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by disregarded; but as it was
      not a matter which really involved her happiness, as Henry must be the
      best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a most persuasive
      smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each
      other, she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister,
      entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there, and
      then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the
      young people in general, and that did so particularly promote the pleasure
      of the two so dear to her.
    
    
      &ldquo;I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,&rdquo; was her observation to
      Mary.
    
    
      &ldquo;I dare say she is,&rdquo; replied Mary coldly. &ldquo;I imagine both sisters are.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think of
      Mr. Rushworth!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may do her
      some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s property and independence, and
      wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. A man might represent
      the county with such an estate; a man might escape a profession and
      represent the county.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say he will be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I
      dare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to put
      him in the way of doing anything yet.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,&rdquo; said
      Mary, after a pause. &ldquo;Do you remember Hawkins Browne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Address to
      Tobacco,&rsquo; in imitation of Pope?&mdash;

      CHAPTER I
    
    
      Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and
      happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
      existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
      little to distress or vex her.
    
    
      She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
      indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister&rsquo;s marriage, been
      mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too
      long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her
      caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
      governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
    
    
      Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s family, less as a
      governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of
      Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before
      Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the
      mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and
      the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living
      together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just
      what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor&rsquo;s judgment, but directed
      chiefly by her own.
    
    
      The real evils, indeed, of Emma&rsquo;s situation were the power of having
      rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well
      of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her
      many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that
      they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.
    
    
      Sorrow came&mdash;a gentle sorrow&mdash;but not at all in the shape of any
      disagreeable consciousness.&mdash;Miss Taylor married. It was Miss
      Taylor&rsquo;s loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this
      beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.
      The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were
      left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long
      evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and
      she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.
    
    
      The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a
      man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant
      manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what
      self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the
      match; but it was a black morning&rsquo;s work for her. The want of Miss Taylor
      would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness&mdash;the
      kindness, the affection of sixteen years&mdash;how she had taught and how
      she had played with her from five years old&mdash;how she had devoted all
      her powers to attach and amuse her in health&mdash;and how nursed her
      through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was
      owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing
      and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella&rsquo;s marriage, on
      their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
      She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,
      well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,
      interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in
      every pleasure, every scheme of hers&mdash;one to whom she could speak
      every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could
      never find fault.
    
    
      How was she to bear the change?&mdash;It was true that her friend was
      going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be
      the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a
      Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and
      domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual
      solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He
      could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
    
    
      The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not
      married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for
      having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or
      body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere
      beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his
      talents could not have recommended him at any time.
    
    
      Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being
      settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily
      reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled
      through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from
      Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
      and give her pleasant society again.
    
    
      Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to
      which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name,
      did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in
      consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the
      place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who
      could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a
      melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for
      impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be
      cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily
      depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with
      them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was
      always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own
      daughter&rsquo;s marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion,
      though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged
      to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness,
      and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel
      differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor
      had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a
      great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.
      Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such
      thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly
      as he had said at dinner,
    
    
      &ldquo;Poor Miss Taylor!&mdash;I wish she were here again. What a pity it is
      that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a
      good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good
      wife;&mdash;and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever,
      and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A house of her own!&mdash;But where is the advantage of a house of her
      own? This is three times as large.&mdash;And you have never any odd
      humours, my dear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!&mdash;We
      shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay wedding
      visit very soon.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not
      walk half so far.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to
      be sure.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a
      little way;&mdash;and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying
      our visit?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;They are to be put into Mr. Weston&rsquo;s stable, papa. You know we have
      settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last
      night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to
      Randalls, because of his daughter&rsquo;s being housemaid there. I only doubt
      whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You
      got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned
      her&mdash;James is so obliged to you!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not
      have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure
      she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I
      have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and
      asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here
      to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the
      right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant;
      and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about
      her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his daughter,
      you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we
      all are.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and
      hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the
      evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The backgammon-table
      was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it
      unnecessary.
    
    
      Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
      only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
      connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella&rsquo;s husband. He lived
      about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,
      and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their
      mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after some
      days&rsquo; absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in
      Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse
      for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him
      good; and his many inquiries after &ldquo;poor Isabella&rdquo; and her children were
      answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully
      observed, &ldquo;It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late
      hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I
      must draw back from your great fire.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch
      cold.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here.
      It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I
      wanted them to put off the wedding.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;By the bye&mdash;I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of
      what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my
      congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you
      all behave? Who cried most?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Ah! poor Miss Taylor! &lsquo;Tis a sad business.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say
      &lsquo;poor Miss Taylor.&rsquo; I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it
      comes to the question of dependence or independence!&mdash;At any rate, it
      must be better to have only one to please than two.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome
      creature!&rdquo; said Emma playfully. &ldquo;That is what you have in your head, I
      know&mdash;and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse, with a
      sigh. &ldquo;I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr.
      Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only
      myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know&mdash;in a
      joke&mdash;it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in
      Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though
      this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be
      so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect
      such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.
    
    
      &ldquo;Emma knows I never flatter her,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;but I meant no
      reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to
      please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a
      gainer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Emma, willing to let it pass&mdash;&ldquo;you want to hear about
      the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved
      charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a
      tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were
      going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear Emma bears every thing so well,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;But, Mr.
      Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am
      sure she will miss her more than she thinks for.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. &ldquo;It is
      impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Knightley. &ldquo;We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could
      suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor&rsquo;s
      advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor&rsquo;s time
      of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to
      be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself
      to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad
      to have her so happily married.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&rdquo; said Emma, &ldquo;and a very
      considerable one&mdash;that I made the match myself. I made the match, you
      know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the
      right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may
      comfort me for any thing.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &ldquo;Ah! my
      dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever
      you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for
      other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such
      success, you know!&mdash;Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry
      again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who
      seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied
      either in his business in town or among his friends here, always
      acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful&mdash;Mr. Weston need not
      spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.
      Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a
      promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle
      not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject,
      but I believed none of it.
    
    
      &ldquo;Ever since the day&mdash;about four years ago&mdash;that Miss Taylor and
      I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he
      darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
      Farmer Mitchell&rsquo;s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match
      from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,
      dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not understand what you mean by &lsquo;success,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley.
      &ldquo;Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately
      spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
      about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady&rsquo;s mind! But if,
      which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only
      your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, &lsquo;I think it would
      be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,&rsquo; and
      saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk
      of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky
      guess; and that is all that can be said.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?&mdash;I
      pity you.&mdash;I thought you cleverer&mdash;for, depend upon it a lucky
      guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to
      my poor word &lsquo;success,&rsquo; which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so
      entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but
      I think there may be a third&mdash;a something between the do-nothing and
      the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston&rsquo;s visits here, and given many
      little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have
      come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to
      comprehend that.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,
      unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own
      concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to
      them, by interference.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,&rdquo; rejoined Mr.
      Woodhouse, understanding but in part. &ldquo;But, my dear, pray do not make any
      more matches; they are silly things, and break up one&rsquo;s family circle
      grievously.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.
      Elton, papa,&mdash;I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody
      in Highbury who deserves him&mdash;and he has been here a whole year, and
      has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have
      him single any longer&mdash;and I thought when he was joining their hands
      to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind
      office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only
      way I have of doing him a service.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young
      man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any
      attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will
      be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to
      meet him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley,
      laughing, &ldquo;and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better
      thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish
      and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a
      man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II
    
    
      Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,
      which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility
      and property. He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early
      in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more
      homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an
      active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of
      his county, then embodied.
    
    
      Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his
      military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire
      family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,
      except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full
      of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.
    
    
      Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her
      fortune&mdash;though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate&mdash;was
      not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite
      mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due
      decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much
      happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a
      husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due
      to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but
      though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had
      resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not
      enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother&rsquo;s unreasonable
      anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. They lived beyond
      their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did
      not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of
      Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.
    
    
      Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as
      making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the
      bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years&rsquo; marriage, he was
      rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the
      expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy had, with the
      additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother&rsquo;s, been
      the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having
      no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to
      care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after
      her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be
      supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,
      the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and
      he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as
      he could.
    
    
      A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and
      engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in
      London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which
      brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,
      where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation
      and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his
      life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy
      competence&mdash;enough to secure the purchase of a little estate
      adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for&mdash;enough to marry a
      woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the
      wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.
    
    
      It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes;
      but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not
      shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase
      Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had
      gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.
      He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was
      beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater
      happiness than in any yet passed through. He had never been an unhappy
      man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;
      but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly
      amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its
      being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude
      than to feel it.
    
    
      He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for
      as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle&rsquo;s
      heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name
      of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore, that he
      should ever want his father&rsquo;s assistance. His father had no apprehension
      of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;
      but it was not in Mr. Weston&rsquo;s nature to imagine that any caprice could be
      strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly
      dear. He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his
      fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort
      of pride in him too. He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the
      place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.
    
    
      Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively
      curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little
      returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit his
      father had been often talked of but never achieved.
    
    
      Now, upon his father&rsquo;s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most
      proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a
      dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with
      Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now
      was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope
      strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother
      on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included
      some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. &ldquo;I suppose
      you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to
      Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr.
      Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he
      never saw such a handsome letter in his life.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed
      a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was
      an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition
      to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage
      had already secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had
      lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where
      the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
      for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.
    
    
      She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without
      pain, of Emma&rsquo;s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour&rsquo;s ennui,
      from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble
      character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have
      been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would
      bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations.
      And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from
      Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr.
      Weston&rsquo;s disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching
      season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week
      together.
    
    
      Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.
      Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction&mdash;her more
      than satisfaction&mdash;her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so
      apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by
      surprize at his being still able to pity &lsquo;poor Miss Taylor,&rsquo; when they
      left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her
      go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of
      her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s giving a gentle
      sigh, and saying, &ldquo;Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.&rdquo;
     
    
      There was no recovering Miss Taylor&mdash;nor much likelihood of ceasing
      to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.
      The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by
      being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had
      been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could bear
      nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from
      himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;
      and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any
      wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to
      prevent any body&rsquo;s eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr.
      Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent,
      gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr.
      Woodhouse&rsquo;s life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge
      (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that
      wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many&mdash;perhaps with most
      people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of
      his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly
      married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his
      benevolent nerves till it was all gone.
    
    
      There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen
      with a slice of Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.
      Woodhouse would never believe it.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III
    
    
      Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to
      have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from
      his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,
      his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little
      circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much intercourse with
      any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large
      dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would
      visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury, including
      Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining,
      the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not unfrequently,
      through Emma&rsquo;s persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine
      with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he
      fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an
      evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.
    
    
      Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by
      Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of
      exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies
      and society of Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely
      daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
    
    
      After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were
      Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the
      service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried
      home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James
      or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a
      grievance.
    
    
      Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady,
      almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her single
      daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and
      respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can
      excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a
      woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the
      very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;
      and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or
      frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. She had never
      boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without
      distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing
      mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible.
      And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without
      good-will. It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which
      worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested in every body&rsquo;s
      happiness, quicksighted to every body&rsquo;s merits; thought herself a most
      fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent
      mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted
      for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented
      and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of
      felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which
      exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless
      gossip.
    
    
      Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School&mdash;not of a seminary, or an
      establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined
      nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new
      principles and new systems&mdash;and where young ladies for enormous pay
      might be screwed out of health and into vanity&mdash;but a real, honest,
      old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of
      accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be
      sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little
      education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s
      school was in high repute&mdash;and very deservedly; for Highbury was
      reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,
      gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great
      deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own
      hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked
      after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had
      worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the
      occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.
      Woodhouse&rsquo;s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat
      parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a
      few sixpences by his fireside.
    
    
      These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to
      collect; and happy was she, for her father&rsquo;s sake, in the power; though,
      as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of
      Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and
      very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the
      quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so
      spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.
    
    
      As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the
      present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most
      respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most
      welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew
      very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her
      beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer
      dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.
    
    
      Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed
      her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s school, and somebody had lately
      raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This
      was all that was generally known of her history. She had no visible
      friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned
      from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at
      school there with her.
    
    
      She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which
      Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine
      bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great
      sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased
      with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the
      acquaintance.
    
    
      She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith&rsquo;s
      conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging&mdash;not
      inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk&mdash;and yet so far from
      pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly
      grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by
      the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been
      used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.
      Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural
      graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its
      connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.
      The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of
      people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the name of Martin,
      whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr.
      Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell&mdash;very creditably,
      she believed&mdash;she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them&mdash;but
      they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of
      a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite
      perfect. She would notice her; she would improve her; she would
      detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society;
      she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an interesting,
      and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation
      in life, her leisure, and powers.
    
    
      She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and
      listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the
      evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which
      always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and
      watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the
      fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of
      a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every
      thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted
      with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help
      and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency
      which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples
      of their guests.
    
    
      Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s feelings were in sad warfare. He
      loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his
      youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him
      rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would
      have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made
      him grieve that they would eat.
    
    
      Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,
      with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain
      himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to
      say:
    
    
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg
      boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg
      better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body
      else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see&mdash;one
      of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little
      bit of tart&mdash;a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You
      need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the
      custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small
      half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree
      with you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma allowed her father to talk&mdash;but supplied her visitors in a much
      more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular
      pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was quite
      equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in
      Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as
      pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly
      gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss
      Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with
      her at last!
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IV
    
    
      Harriet Smith&rsquo;s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and
      decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and
      telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so
      did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had
      very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect Mrs.
      Weston&rsquo;s loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the
      shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long
      walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s marriage
      her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to
      Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one
      whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition
      to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she
      approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.
    
    
      Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful
      disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided
      by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very
      amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating
      what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste,
      though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was
      quite convinced of Harriet Smith&rsquo;s being exactly the young friend she
      wanted&mdash;exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend
      as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted.
      Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a
      sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard
      which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one
      to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done;
      for Harriet every thing.
    
    
      Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were
      the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell every thing
      in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to
      fancy what she liked&mdash;but she could never believe that in the same
      situation she should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no
      penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs.
      Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.
    
    
      Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the
      school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation&mdash;and
      but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have
      been the whole. But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had
      spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the
      pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the
      place. Emma encouraged her talkativeness&mdash;amused by such a picture of
      another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could
      speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s having &ldquo;two
      parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as
      Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived
      five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of
      them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow
      indeed; and of Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s saying as she was so fond of it, it should be
      called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in
      their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea:&mdash;a
      very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.&rdquo;
     
    
      For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;
      but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She
      had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son
      and son&rsquo;s wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr.
      Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with
      approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a
      single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she
      did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and
      kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required
      to sink herself forever.
    
    
      With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and
      meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and
      there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of
      the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and
      dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging. He
      had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts,
      because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he
      was so very obliging. He had his shepherd&rsquo;s son into the parlour one night
      on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could sing a
      little himself. She believed he was very clever, and understood every
      thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been
      bid more for his wool than any body in the country. She believed every
      body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs.
      Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that
      it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was
      sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she wanted
      him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well done, Mrs. Martin!&rdquo; thought Emma. &ldquo;You know what you are about.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs.
      Goddard a beautiful goose&mdash;the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever
      seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three
      teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with
      her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his
      own business? He does not read?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&mdash;that is, no&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I believe he has
      read a good deal&mdash;but not what you would think any thing of. He reads
      the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the
      window seats&mdash;but he reads all them to himself. But sometimes
      of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out
      of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the
      Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The
      Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned
      them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.&rdquo;
     
    
      The next question was&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! not handsome&mdash;not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at
      first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know, after
      a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and then,
      and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has
      passed you very often.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any
      idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the
      very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are precisely
      the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or
      two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to
      be useful to their families in some way or other. But a farmer can need
      none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice
      as in every other he is below it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;
      but he knows you very well indeed&mdash;I mean by sight.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,
      indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine
      his age to be?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd
      just a fortnight and a day&rsquo;s difference&mdash;which is very odd.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is
      perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they
      are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably
      repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young
      woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very
      desirable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not
      born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely
      to make&mdash;cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money
      he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family
      property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so
      forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time,
      it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no
      indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of
      taking a boy another year.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;&mdash;I
      mean, as to being acquainted with his wife&mdash;for though his sisters,
      from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does
      not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The
      misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your
      associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter,
      and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your
      own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in
      degrading you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and
      you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body
      can do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would
      have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even
      of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well
      connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd
      acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be
      in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by
      your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will
      probably be some mere farmer&rsquo;s daughter, without education.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body
      but what had had some education&mdash;and been very well brought up.
      However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours&mdash;and I am
      sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always
      have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should
      be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me.
      But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better
      not visit her, if I can help it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no
      alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but
      she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious
      difficulty, on Harriet&rsquo;s side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her
      own.
    
    
      They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell
      road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked
      with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was not sorry to
      have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while
      they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with
      Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a
      sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he
      came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the
      ground he had gained in Harriet&rsquo;s inclination. Harriet was not insensible
      of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father&rsquo;s gentleness with
      admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what
      manner was.
    
    
      They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be
      kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,
      and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to
      compose.
    
    
      &ldquo;Only think of our happening to meet him!&mdash;How very odd! It was quite
      a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not
      think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls most
      days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so
      busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes
      again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss
      Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you
      think him so very plain?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He is very plain, undoubtedly&mdash;remarkably plain:&mdash;but that is
      nothing compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to
      expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be
      so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a
      degree or two nearer gentility.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Harriet, in a mortified voice, &ldquo;he is not so genteel as
      real gentlemen.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
      repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must
      yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you
      have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be
      surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin
      again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature&mdash;and
      rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable
      before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure
      you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the
      uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood
      here.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and
      way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But
      Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare
      Mr. Martin with him. You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman
      so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the only gentleman
      you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton?
      Compare Mr. Martin with either of them. Compare their manner of
      carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must
      see the difference.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&mdash;there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an
      old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows,
      Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad;
      the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or
      awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age.
      Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston&rsquo;s time
      of life?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is no saying, indeed,&rdquo; replied Harriet rather solemnly.
    
    
      &ldquo;But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,
      vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing
      but profit and loss.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
      circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He
      was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else&mdash;which
      is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to do with books?
      And I have no doubt that he will thrive, and be a very rich man in
      time&mdash;and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I wonder he did not remember the book&rdquo;&mdash;was all Harriet&rsquo;s answer,
      and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be
      safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her
      next beginning was,
    
    
      &ldquo;In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton&rsquo;s manners are superior to Mr.
      Knightley&rsquo;s or Mr. Weston&rsquo;s. They have more gentleness. They might be more
      safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a
      bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because
      there is so much good-humour with it&mdash;but that would not do to be
      copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s downright, decided, commanding sort
      of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and
      situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about
      copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young
      man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr.
      Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to
      be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any
      design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional
      softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to
      be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you
      what he said of you the other day?&rdquo;
     
    
      She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.
      Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and
      said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
    
    
      Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young
      farmer out of Harriet&rsquo;s head. She thought it would be an excellent match;
      and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have
      much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body else must
      think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any body should
      have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain
      during the very first evening of Harriet&rsquo;s coming to Hartfield. The longer
      she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. Mr.
      Elton&rsquo;s situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and
      without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could
      fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He had a comfortable home
      for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the
      vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known to have some independent
      property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured,
      well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful
      understanding or knowledge of the world.
    
    
      She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful
      girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was
      foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet&rsquo;s there could be little
      doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual
      weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a young
      man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very
      handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there
      being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:&mdash;but
      the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin&rsquo;s riding about the
      country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton&rsquo;s
      admiration.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER V
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley,
      &ldquo;of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a
      bad thing.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?&mdash;why so?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I think they will neither of them do the other any good.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a
      new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been
      seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we
      feel!&mdash;Not think they will do each other any good! This will
      certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.
      Knightley.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing
      Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks
      exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday, and
      agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl
      in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow
      you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone,
      that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be
      a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own
      sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine your objection to
      Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman which Emma&rsquo;s friend
      ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better
      informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more herself. They will
      read together. She means it, I know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old. I
      have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books
      that she meant to read regularly through&mdash;and very good lists they
      were&mdash;very well chosen, and very neatly arranged&mdash;sometimes
      alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up
      when only fourteen&mdash;I remember thinking it did her judgment so much
      credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made
      out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of
      steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring
      industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.
      Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet
      Smith will do nothing.&mdash;You never could persuade her to read half so
      much as you wished.&mdash;You know you could not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, &ldquo;that I thought so then;&mdash;but
      since we have parted, I can never remember Emma&rsquo;s omitting to do any thing
      I wished.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,&rdquo;&mdash;said
      Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. &ldquo;But I,&rdquo; he
      soon added, &ldquo;who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still
      see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her
      family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to answer
      questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always quick and
      assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma
      has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the
      only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother&rsquo;s talents, and
      must have been under subjection to her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on your
      recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s family and wanted another
      situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any
      body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;You are better placed here; very fit for
      a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to
      be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not
      give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise;
      but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very
      material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you
      were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should
      certainly have named Miss Taylor.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such
      a man as Mr. Weston.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that
      with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will
      not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of
      comfort, or his son may plague him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I hope not that.&mdash;It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not
      foretell vexation from that quarter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma&rsquo;s
      genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young
      man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.&mdash;But
      Harriet Smith&mdash;I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her
      the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows
      nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a
      flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her
      ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any thing to
      learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority?
      And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she cannot gain by
      the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the
      other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined enough to be
      uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed
      her home. I am much mistaken if Emma&rsquo;s doctrines give any strength of
      mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the
      varieties of her situation in life.&mdash;They only give a little polish.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I either depend more upon Emma&rsquo;s good sense than you do, or am more
      anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How
      well she looked last night!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very
      well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma&rsquo;s being pretty.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect
      beauty than Emma altogether&mdash;face and figure?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen
      a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old
      friend.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Such an eye!&mdash;the true hazle eye&mdash;and so brilliant! regular
      features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full
      health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
      There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her
      glance. One hears sometimes of a child being &lsquo;the picture of health;&rsquo; now,
      Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up
      health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have not a fault to find with her person,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I think her all
      you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do
      not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome she is, she
      appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. Mrs.
      Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my
      dread of its doing them both harm.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing
      them any harm. With all dear Emma&rsquo;s little faults, she is an excellent
      creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a
      truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will
      never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where
      Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I
      will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.
      John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and
      Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite frightened
      enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions with me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but
      excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you
      know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma&rsquo;s mother
      might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible
      good can arise from Harriet Smith&rsquo;s intimacy being made a matter of much
      discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little
      inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected
      that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves
      the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of
      pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to give advice,
      that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of
      office.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for it. It is very good
      advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found;
      for it shall be attended to.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about
      her sister.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Be satisfied,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my
      ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella
      does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;
      perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one
      feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston gently, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just
      nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she
      cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love
      with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt
      of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts to
      attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution
      at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weston, &ldquo;as can well be; and while she is so happy
      at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would
      be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s account. I do not
      recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the
      state, I assure you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and
      Mr. Weston&rsquo;s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at
      Randalls respecting Emma&rsquo;s destiny, but it was not desirable to have them
      suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards
      made to &ldquo;What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?&rdquo;
       convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VI
    
    
      Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet&rsquo;s fancy a proper
      direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good
      purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.
      Elton&rsquo;s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and
      as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration
      by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much
      liking on Harriet&rsquo;s side, as there could be any occasion for. She was
      quite convinced of Mr. Elton&rsquo;s being in the fairest way of falling in
      love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He
      talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppose
      any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of the
      striking improvement of Harriet&rsquo;s manner, since her introduction at
      Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing
      attachment.
    
    
      &ldquo;You have given Miss Smith all that she required,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you have made
      her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you,
      but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior
      to what she received from nature.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted
      drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural
      grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very
      little.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;If it were admissible to contradict a lady,&rdquo; said the gallant Mr. Elton&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught
      her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded
      decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition
      more truly amiable.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it.&rdquo; And it was spoken with a sort of sighing
      animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased
      another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to
      have Harriet&rsquo;s picture.
    
    
      &ldquo;Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;did you ever
      sit for your picture?&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with
      a very interesting naivete,
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, no, never.&rdquo;
     
    
      No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,
    
    
      &ldquo;What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would give
      any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself. You do not
      know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for
      taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to
      have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it
      up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to
      me. It would be such a delight to have her picture!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let me entreat you,&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton; &ldquo;it would indeed be a delight! Let
      me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour
      of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me
      ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and
      flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her
      drawing-room, at Randalls?&rdquo;
     
    
      Yes, good man!&mdash;thought Emma&mdash;but what has all that to do with
      taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don&rsquo;t pretend to be in
      raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Well, if you
      give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I
      can do. Harriet&rsquo;s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness
      difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the
      lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Exactly so&mdash;The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth&mdash;I
      have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do
      it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks so
      little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering me?
      How completely it meant, &lsquo;why should my picture be drawn?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I
      cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and
      she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest
      pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and
      therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at
      portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might
      decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were
      displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and
      water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do
      every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than
      many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.
      She played and sang;&mdash;and drew in almost every style; but steadiness
      had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of
      excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to
      have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an
      artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,
      or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it
      deserved.
    
    
      There was merit in every drawing&mdash;in the least finished, perhaps the
      most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there
      been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions
      would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases
      every body; and Miss Woodhouse&rsquo;s performances must be capital.
    
    
      &ldquo;No great variety of faces for you,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;I had only my own family
      to study from. There is my father&mdash;another of my father&mdash;but the
      idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only
      take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston
      again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest
      friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her. There is my
      sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!&mdash;and the face
      not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have
      sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children
      that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of
      those four children;&mdash;there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from
      one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any
      one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not
      refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand
      still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them,
      beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any
      of mama&rsquo;s children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a
      baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a
      likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his
      head most conveniently. That&rsquo;s very like. I am rather proud of little
      George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,&rdquo;&mdash;unclosing
      a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length&mdash;&ldquo;my last
      and my best&mdash;my brother, Mr. John Knightley.&mdash;This did not want
      much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would
      never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after
      all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it&mdash;(Mrs.
      Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like)&mdash;only
      too handsome&mdash;too flattering&mdash;but that was a fault on the right
      side&rdquo;&mdash;after all this, came poor dear Isabella&rsquo;s cold approbation of&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      it was a little like&mdash;but to be sure it did not do him justice. We
      had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was
      made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and
      so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable
      likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;&mdash;and, as I
      said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet&rsquo;s
      sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the
      case at present, I will break my resolution now.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was
      repeating, &ldquo;No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you
      observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,&rdquo; with so interesting a
      consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better
      leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the
      declaration must wait a little longer.
    
    
      She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a
      whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley&rsquo;s, and was
      destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station
      over the mantelpiece.
    
    
      The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not
      keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of
      youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no
      doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every
      touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and
      gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it,
      and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her to
      employ him in reading.
    
    
      &ldquo;If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed!
      It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the
      irksomeness of Miss Smith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.
      She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less
      would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the
      smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and
      be charmed.&mdash;There was no being displeased with such an encourager,
      for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was
      possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance
      were unexceptionable.
    
    
      The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough pleased
      with the first day&rsquo;s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want of
      likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to
      throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height,
      and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in
      every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place
      with credit to them both&mdash;a standing memorial of the beauty of one,
      the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other
      agreeable associations as Mr. Elton&rsquo;s very promising attachment was likely
      to add.
    
    
      Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,
      entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
    
    
      &ldquo;By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the
      party.&rdquo;
     
    
      The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,
      took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the
      picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased, but
      Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every
      criticism.
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,&rdquo;&mdash;observed
      Mrs. Weston to him&mdash;not in the least suspecting that she was
      addressing a lover.&mdash;&ldquo;The expression of the eye is most correct, but
      Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of her
      face that she has them not.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I cannot agree with you. It appears to me
      a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a likeness
      in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You have made her too tall, Emma,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley.
    
    
      Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,
    
    
      &ldquo;Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she
      is sitting down&mdash;which naturally presents a different&mdash;which in
      short gives exactly the idea&mdash;and the proportions must be preserved,
      you know. Proportions, fore-shortening.&mdash;Oh no! it gives one exactly
      the idea of such a height as Miss Smith&rsquo;s. Exactly so indeed!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; said Mr. Woodhouse. &ldquo;So prettily done! Just as your
      drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as
      you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be
      sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders&mdash;and
      it makes one think she must catch cold.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.
      Look at the tree.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You, sir, may say any thing,&rdquo; cried Mr. Elton, &ldquo;but I must confess that I
      regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors;
      and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other situation
      would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss Smith&rsquo;s
      manners&mdash;and altogether&mdash;Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep
      my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.&rdquo;
     
    
      The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few
      difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the
      order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste
      could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,
      must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could
      not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of
      December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was
      removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. &ldquo;Might he be trusted with
      the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he
      could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he
      should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He was too good!&mdash;she could not endure the thought!&mdash;she would
      not give him such a troublesome office for the world,&rdquo;&mdash;brought on
      the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,&mdash;and a very few
      minutes settled the business.
    
    
      Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the
      directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety
      without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being
      incommoded enough.
    
    
      &ldquo;What a precious deposit!&rdquo; said he with a tender sigh, as he received it.
    
    
      &ldquo;This man is almost too gallant to be in love,&rdquo; thought Emma. &ldquo;I should
      say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being
      in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it
      will be an &lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; as he says himself; but he does sigh and
      languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a
      principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is his
      gratitude on Harriet&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VII
    
    
      The very day of Mr. Elton&rsquo;s going to London produced a fresh occasion for
      Emma&rsquo;s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield, as
      usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return
      again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and
      with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have
      happened which she was longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out.
      She had heard, as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s, that Mr. Martin
      had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor
      particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his
      sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually
      found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a
      letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and
      contained a direct proposal of marriage. &ldquo;Who could have thought it? She
      was so surprized she did not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of
      marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as
      if he really loved her very much&mdash;but she did not know&mdash;and so,
      she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should
      do.&mdash;&rdquo; Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and
      so doubtful.
    
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the young man is determined not to lose any
      thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Will you read the letter?&rdquo; cried Harriet. &ldquo;Pray do. I&rsquo;d rather you
      would.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style
      of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no
      grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a
      gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the
      sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was
      short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,
      even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood
      anxiously watching for her opinion, with a &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; and was at last
      forced to add, &ldquo;Is it a good letter? or is it too short?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, a very good letter,&rdquo; replied Emma rather slowly&mdash;&ldquo;so
      good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his
      sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I
      saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left
      quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no,
      certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman.
      No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for&mdash;thinks
      strongly and clearly&mdash;and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts
      naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the
      sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not
      coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had
      expected.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the still waiting Harriet;&mdash;&ldquo;well&mdash;and&mdash;and
      what shall I do?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this
      letter?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course&mdash;and
      speedily.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express
      yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not being
      intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal;
      no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the
      pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves
      unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. You need not be prompted to
      write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You think I ought to refuse him then,&rdquo; said Harriet, looking down.
    
    
      &ldquo;Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any
      doubt as to that? I thought&mdash;but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have
      been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you
      feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you
      were consulting me only as to the wording of it.&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:
    
    
      &ldquo;You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;No, I do not; that is, I do not mean&mdash;What shall I do? What would
      you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to
      do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do with
      it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I had no notion that he liked me so very much,&rdquo; said Harriet,
      contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her
      silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter
      might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,
    
    
      &ldquo;I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts
      as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to
      refuse him. If she can hesitate as to &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she ought to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; 
      directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful
      feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older
      than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to
      influence you.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to&mdash;but if you would
      just advise me what I had best do&mdash;No, no, I do not mean that&mdash;As
      you say, one&rsquo;s mind ought to be quite made up&mdash;One should not be
      hesitating&mdash;It is a very serious thing.&mdash;It will be safer to say
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; perhaps.&mdash;Do you think I had better say &lsquo;No?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; said Emma, smiling graciously, &ldquo;would I advise you
      either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you
      prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most
      agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate?
      You blush, Harriet.&mdash;Does any body else occur to you at this moment
      under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not
      be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     
    
      The symptoms were favourable.&mdash;Instead of answering, Harriet turned
      away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter
      was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without
      regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong
      hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said&mdash;
    
    
      &ldquo;Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well
      as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost
      made up my mind&mdash;to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what
      you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself,
      but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in
      approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved
      me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your
      marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I
      said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have
      been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have visited Mrs. Robert
      Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever.&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her
      forcibly.
    
    
      &ldquo;You could not have visited me!&rdquo; she cried, looking aghast. &ldquo;No, to be
      sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have
      been too dreadful!&mdash;What an escape!&mdash;Dear Miss Woodhouse, I
      would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for
      any thing in the world.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it
      must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I
      must have given you up.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear me!&mdash;How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me
      never to come to Hartfield any more!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Dear affectionate creature!&mdash;You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!&mdash;You
      confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I
      wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must have
      a pretty good opinion of himself.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I do not think he is conceited either, in general,&rdquo; said Harriet, her
      conscience opposing such censure; &ldquo;at least, he is very good natured, and
      I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard for&mdash;but
      that is quite a different thing from&mdash;and you know, though he may
      like me, it does not follow that I should&mdash;and certainly I must
      confess that since my visiting here I have seen people&mdash;and if one
      comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,
      one is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think
      Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and
      his being so much attached to me&mdash;and his writing such a letter&mdash;but
      as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted.
      A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he
      is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh no;&mdash;and it is but a short letter too.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a &ldquo;very true;
      and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which
      might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband
      could write a good letter.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
      happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But
      how shall I do? What shall I say?&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised
      its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her
      assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance
      being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence. The
      looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a softening
      tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few
      decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of
      making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother and sisters
      would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not fancy her
      ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at
      that moment, he would have been accepted after all.
    
    
      This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business was
      finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but Emma
      could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by
      speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of
      Mr. Elton.
    
    
      &ldquo;I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,&rdquo; was said in rather a
      sorrowful tone.
    
    
      &ldquo;Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You are
      a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but
      at Hartfield.&rdquo;
     
    
      Some time afterwards it was, &ldquo;I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much
      surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would&mdash;for
      Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a
      linen-draper.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of
      a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity
      as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear valuable in her
      eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she is quite in the
      dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the
      tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only
      people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves.&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people
      should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but
      still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr.
      Martin.
    
    
      &ldquo;Now he has got my letter,&rdquo; said she softly. &ldquo;I wonder what they are all
      doing&mdash;whether his sisters know&mdash;if he is unhappy, they will be
      unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
      employed,&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing your
      picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the
      original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to
      hear your name, your own dear name.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My picture!&mdash;But he has left my picture in Bond-street.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Has he so!&mdash;Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little
      modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till
      just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this
      evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family, it
      introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest
      feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How
      cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all
      are!&rdquo;
     
    
      Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER VIII
    
    
      Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been
      spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a
      bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every
      respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible
      just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two
      to Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s, but it was then to be settled that she should return to
      Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
    
    
      While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.
      Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his
      mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was
      induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his own
      civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had
      nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short, decided answers,
      an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of
      the other.
    
    
      &ldquo;Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not
      consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma&rsquo;s advice and go
      out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better
      take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr.
      Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to
      entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my
      three turns&mdash;my winter walk.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You cannot do better, sir.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a
      very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you
      have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the
      sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the
      garden door for you.&rdquo;
     
    
      Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being
      immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more
      chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more
      voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.
    
    
      &ldquo;I cannot rate her beauty as you do,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but she is a pretty little
      creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition. Her
      character depends upon those she is with; but in good hands she will turn
      out a valuable woman.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you
      that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl&rsquo;s
      giggle; she really does you credit.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been
      of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they
      may. You do not often overpower me with it.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Highbury gossips!&mdash;Tiresome wretches!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing.
      He presently added, with a smile,
    
    
      &ldquo;I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I
      have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something
      to her advantage.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Indeed! how so? of what sort?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A very serious sort, I assure you;&rdquo; still smiling.
    
    
      &ldquo;Very serious! I can think of but one thing&mdash;Who is in love with her?
      Who makes you their confidant?&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton&rsquo;s having dropt a hint. Mr.
      Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr. Elton
      looked up to him.
    
    
      &ldquo;I have reason to think,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that Harriet Smith will soon have
      an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:&mdash;Robert
      Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have
      done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;He is very obliging,&rdquo; said Emma; &ldquo;but is he sure that Harriet means to
      marry him?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to the
      Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows I have
      a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe, considers me
      as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I thought it would
      be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I thought her too young:
      in short, whether I approved his choice altogether; having some
      apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since your
      making so much of her) as in a line of society above him. I was very much
      pleased with all that he said. I never hear better sense from any one than
      Robert Martin. He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and
      very well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,
      and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an
      excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in
      advising him to marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that
      being the case, I was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair
      lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never
      esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and,
      I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man
      ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly
      suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady,
      and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely
      that he should be at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s to-day; and she may be detained by a
      visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Knightley,&rdquo; said Emma, who had been smiling to herself through
      a great part of this speech, &ldquo;how do you know that Mr. Martin did not
      speak yesterday?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied he, surprized, &ldquo;I do not absolutely know it; but it
      may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will tell you something, in return for what you have
      told me. He did speak yesterday&mdash;that is, he wrote, and was refused.&rdquo;
     
    
      This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.
      Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood
      up, in tall indignation, and said,
    
    
      &ldquo;Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the
      foolish girl about?&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Oh! to be sure,&rdquo; cried Emma, &ldquo;it is always incomprehensible to a man that
      a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a
      woman to be ready for any body who asks her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning
      of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I
      hope you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I saw her answer!&mdash;nothing could be clearer.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;You saw her answer!&mdash;you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your
      doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel
      that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I
      cannot admit him to be Harriet&rsquo;s equal; and am rather surprized indeed
      that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem
      to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Not Harriet&rsquo;s equal!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with
      calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, &ldquo;No, he is not her equal
      indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma,
      your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith&rsquo;s
      claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than
      Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with
      probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable
      relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She is
      not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught
      nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing
      herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,
      is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and
      she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the
      match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad
      connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might
      do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he
      could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was
      willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of
      disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright
      and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her
      side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be
      a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even your
      satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would
      not regret your friend&rsquo;s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being
      settled so well. I remember saying to myself, &lsquo;Even Emma, with all her
      partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any
      such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his
      merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!
      Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I
      could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think
      it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very
      different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just
      to Harriet&rsquo;s claims. They would be estimated very differently by others as
      well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is
      undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.&mdash;The sphere in which
      she moves is much above his.&mdash;It would be a degradation.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a
      respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may be
      called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay for the
      offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is
      brought up.&mdash;There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a
      gentleman&mdash;and a gentleman of fortune.&mdash;Her allowance is very
      liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.&mdash;That
      she is a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates
      with gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.&mdash;She is
      superior to Mr. Robert Martin.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Whoever might be her parents,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley, &ldquo;whoever may have had
      the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan
      to introduce her into what you would call good society. After receiving a
      very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s hands to shift as
      she can;&mdash;to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s line, to have Mrs.
      Goddard&rsquo;s acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for
      her; and it was good enough. She desired nothing better herself.
      Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her
      own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as happy as possible with the
      Martins in the summer. She had no sense of superiority then. If she has it
      now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.
      Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt
      persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too
      much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish
      passion. And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know.
      Depend upon it he had encouragement.&rdquo;
     
    
      It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this
      assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
    
    
      &ldquo;You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are
      unjust to Harriet. Harriet&rsquo;s claims to marry well are not so contemptible
      as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense
      than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding
      spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her
      to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you,
      that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial
      recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful
      girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and
      till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of
      beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with
      well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such
      loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after,
      of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be
      nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending,
      as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble
      opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
      I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such
      beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost
      enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it
      as you do.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; cried she playfully. &ldquo;I know that is the feeling of
      you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man
      delights in&mdash;what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his
      judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to
      marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just
      entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because
      she does not accept the first offer she receives? No&mdash;pray let her
      have time to look about her.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,&rdquo; said Mr. Knightley
      presently, &ldquo;though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive
      that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up
      with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,
      in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.
      Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so
      easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet
      Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a
      very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want
      silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves
      with a girl of such obscurity&mdash;and most prudent men would be afraid
      of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the
      mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin,
      and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her
      to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing
      less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a
      parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s all the rest of her life&mdash;or, at
      least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,)
      till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master&rsquo;s
      son.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can
      be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry.
      But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she
      has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second
      application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it
      may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I
      might not influence her a little; but I assure you there was very little
      for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much against him, and
      his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is
      not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she
      might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains
      to please her; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have
      been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find
      him disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what
      gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any
      chance with Harriet.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!&rdquo; cried Mr. Knightley.&mdash;&ldquo;Robert
      Martin&rsquo;s manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them;
      and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was
      really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She did
      not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of
      such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she
      had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her
      dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just
      opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed
      in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma&rsquo;s side to talk
      of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his
      thoughts appeared at last in these words.
    
    
      &ldquo;Robert Martin has no great loss&mdash;if he can but think so; and I hope
      it will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known
      to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is
      fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;&mdash;and as
      a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it
      will be all labour in vain.&rdquo;
     
    
      Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,
    
    
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and
      a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an
      imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any body.
      Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is as well
      acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet&rsquo;s. He knows
      that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he
      goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments, when
      there are only men present, I am convinced that he does not mean to throw
      himself away. I have heard him speak with great animation of a large
      family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all
      twenty thousand pounds apiece.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Emma, laughing again. &ldquo;If I had set
      my heart on Mr. Elton&rsquo;s marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to
      open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have
      done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings
      at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.&rdquo;
     
    
      &ldquo;Good morning to you,&rdquo;&mdash;said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He
      was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was
      mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had
      given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,
      was provoking him exceedingly.
    
    
      Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more
      indistinctness in the causes of her&rsquo;s, than in his. She did not always
      feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her
      opinions were right and her adversary&rsquo;s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He walked
      off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She was not so
      materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of
      Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet&rsquo;s staying away so long
      was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the young man&rsquo;s
      coming to Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s that morning, and meeting with Harriet and
      pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure
      after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and
      in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her
      long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,
      and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would, she
      had done nothing which woman&rsquo;s friendship and woman&rsquo;s feelings would not
      justify.
    
    
      He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered
      that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither
      with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of
      Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a
      question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was
      able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be
      true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have heard Mr.
      Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton
      might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money
      matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;
      but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a
      strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no
      such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw
      too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a
      reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable,
      becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr.
      Elton.
    
    
      Harriet&rsquo;s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to
      think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been telling
      her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. Mr.
      Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had
      seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday
      from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize,
      that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to
      return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had
      been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him
      about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to
      absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey
      only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on,
      and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he was
      going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the
      world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the
      bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr. Perry could not quite
      understand him, but he was very sure there must be a lady in the
      case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and
      smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Miss Nash had told her all this,
      and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so
      very significantly at her, &ldquo;that she did not pretend to understand what
      his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton
      could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for,
      beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.&rdquo;
     
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER IX
    
    
      Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with
      herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before
      he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed
      that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent. On the
      contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and
      endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.
    
    
      The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton&rsquo;s
      return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he
      got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just
      as he ought; and as for Harriet&rsquo;s feelings, they were visibly forming
      themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort
      of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin&rsquo;s being
      no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton,
      of the utmost advantage to the latter.
    
    
      Her views of improving her little friend&rsquo;s mind, by a great deal of useful
      reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first
      chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much easier to
      chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work
      at Harriet&rsquo;s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or
      exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged
      Harriet at present, the only mental provision she was making for the
      evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of
      every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed
      paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
    
    
      In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not
      uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard&rsquo;s, had written out at
      least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from
      her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse&rsquo;s help, to get a great many more. Emma
      assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very
      pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in
      form as well as quantity.
    
    
      Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,
      and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. &ldquo;So
      many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young&mdash;he
      wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.&rdquo; And
      it always ended in &ldquo;Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.&rdquo;
     
    
      His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not
      at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired
      Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he
      thought, might come from that quarter.
    
    
      It was by no means his daughter&rsquo;s wish that the intellects of Highbury in
      general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one whose
      assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good
      enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the
      pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and
      at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that
      nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex
      should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest
      puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and
      rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,

INTRODUCTION
With the title of Sense and Sensibility is connected one of those minor
problems which delight the cummin-splitters of criticism. In the Cecilia
of Madame D'Arblay&mdash;the forerunner, if not the model, of Miss Austen&mdash;is a
sentence which at first sight suggests some relationship to the name of
the book which, in the present series, inaugurated Miss Austen's novels.
'The whole of this unfortunate business'&mdash;says a certain didactic Dr.
Lyster, talking in capitals, towards the end of volume three of
Cecilia&mdash;'has been the result of Pride and Prejudice,' and looking to
the admitted familiarity of Miss Austen with Madame D'Arblay's work, it
has been concluded that Miss Austen borrowed from Cecilia, the title of
her second novel. But here comes in the little problem to which we have
referred. Pride and Prejudice it is true, was written and finished
before Sense and Sensibility&mdash;its original title for several years being
First Impressions. Then, in 1797, the author fell to work upon an older
essay in letters &agrave; la Richardson, called Elinor and Marianne, which
she re-christened Sense and Sensibility. This, as we know, was her first
published book; and whatever may be the connection between the title of
Pride and Prejudice and the passage in Cecilia, there is an obvious
connection between the title of Pride and Prejudice and the title of
Sense and Sensibility. If Miss Austen[viii] re-christened Elinor and
Marianne before she changed the title of First Impressions, as she well
may have, it is extremely unlikely that the name of Pride and Prejudice
has anything to do with Cecilia (which, besides, had been published at
least twenty years before). Upon the whole, therefore, it is most likely
that the passage in Madame D'Arblay is a mere coincidence; and that in
Sense and Sensibility, as well as in the novel that succeeded it in
publication, Miss Austen, after the fashion of the old morality plays,
simply substituted the leading characteristics of her principal personages
for their names. Indeed, in Sense and Sensibility the sense of Elinor,
and the sensibility (or rather sensiblerie) of Marianne, are markedly
emphasised in the opening pages of the book But Miss Austen subsequently,
and, as we think, wisely, discarded in her remaining efforts the cheap
attraction of an alliterative title. Emma and Persuasion, Northanger
Abbey and Mansfield Park, are names far more in consonance with the
quiet tone of her easy and unobtrusive art.

Elinor and Marianne was originally written about 1792. After the
completion&mdash;or partial completion, for it was again revised in
1811&mdash;of First Impressions (subsequently Pride and Prejudice),
Miss Austen set about recasting Elinor and Marianne, then composed
in the form of letters; and she had no sooner accomplished this task,
than she began Northanger Abbey. It would be interesting to know to
what extent she remodelled Sense and Sensibility in 1797-98, for we
are told that previous to its publication in 1811 she again devoted a
considerable time to its preparation for the press, and it is clear
that this does not mean the correction of proofs alone, but also a
preliminary revision of MS. Especially would it be interesting if we
could ascertain whether any of its more finished passages, e.g. the
admirable conversation[ix] between the Miss Dashwoods and Willoughby in
chapter x., were the result of those fallow and apparently barren
years at Bath and Southampton, or whether they were already part of
the second version of 1797-98. But upon this matter the records are
mute. A careful examination of the correspondence published by Lord
Brabourne in 1884 only reveals two definite references to Sense and
Sensibility and these are absolutely unfruitful in suggestion. In
April 1811 she speaks of having corrected two sheets of 'S and S,'
which she has scarcely a hope of getting out in the following June;
and in September, an extract from the diary of another member of the
family indirectly discloses the fact that the book had by that time
been published. This extract is a brief reference to a letter which
had been received from Cassandra Austen, begging her correspondent not
to mention that Aunt Jane wrote Sense and Sensibility. Beyond these
minute items of information, and the statement&mdash;already referred to in
the Introduction to Pride and Prejudice&mdash;that she considered herself
overpaid for the labour she had bestowed upon it, absolutely nothing
seems to have been preserved by her descendants respecting her first
printed effort. In the absence of particulars some of her critics have
fallen to speculate upon the reason which made her select it, and not
Pride and Prejudice, for her d&eacute;but; and they have, perhaps
naturally, found in the fact a fresh confirmation of that traditional
blindness of authors to their own best work, which is one of the
commonplaces of literary history. But this is to premise that she
did regard it as her masterpiece, a fact which, apart from this
accident of priority of issue, is, as far as we are aware, nowhere
asserted. A simpler solution is probably that, of the three novels she
had written or sketched by 1811, Pride and Prejudice was languishing
under the stigma of having been refused by one bookseller[x] without the
formality of inspection, while Northanger Abbey was lying perdu in
another bookseller's drawer at Bath. In these circumstances it is
intelligible that she should turn to Sense and Sensibility, when, at
length&mdash;upon the occasion of a visit to her brother in London in the
spring of 1811&mdash;Mr. T. Egerton of the 'Military Library,' Whitehall,
dawned upon the horizon as a practicable publisher.

By the time Sense and Sensibility left the press, Miss Austen was
again domiciled at Chawton Cottage. For those accustomed to the
swarming reviews of our day, with their Babel of notices, it may seem
strange that there should be no record of the effect produced, seeing
that, as already stated, the book sold well enough to enable its
putter-forth to hand over to its author what Mr. Gargery, in Great
Expectations, would have described as 'a cool &pound;150.' Surely Mr.
Egerton, who had visited Miss Austen at Sloane Street, must have later
conveyed to her some intelligence of the way in which her work had
been welcomed by the public. But if he did, it is no longer
discoverable. Mr. Austen Leigh, her first and best biographer, could
find no account either of the publication or of the author's feelings
thereupon. As far as it is possible to judge, the critical verdicts
she obtained were mainly derived from her own relatives and intimate
friends, and some of these latter&mdash;if one may trust a little anthology
which she herself collected, and from which Mr. Austen Leigh prints
extracts&mdash;must have been more often exasperating than sympathetic. The
long chorus of intelligent approval by which she was afterwards
greeted did not begin to be really audible before her death, and her
'fit audience' during her lifetime must have been emphatically 'few,'
Of two criticisms which came out in the Quarterly early in the
century, she could only have seen one, that of 1815; the other, by
Archbishop[xi] Whately, the first which treated her in earnest, did not
appear until she had been three years dead. Dr. Whately deals mainly
with Mansfield Park and Persuasion; his predecessor professed to
review Emma, though he also gives brief summaries of Sense and
Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Austen Leigh, we think,
speaks too contemptuously of this initial notice of 1815. If, at
certain points, it is half-hearted and inadequate, it is still fairly
accurate in its recognition of Miss Austen's supreme merit, as
contrasted with her contemporaries&mdash;to wit, her skill in investing the
fortunes of ordinary characters and the narrative of common
occurrences with all the sustained excitement of romance. The Reviewer
points out very justly that this kind of work, 'being deprived of all
that, according to Bayes, goes "to elevate and surprise," must make
amends by displaying depth of knowledge and dexterity of execution.'
And in these qualities, even with such living competitors of her own
sex as Miss Edgeworth and Miss Brunton (whose Self-control came out
in the same year as Sense and Sensibility), he does not scruple to
declare that 'Miss Austen stands almost alone.' If he omits to lay
stress upon her judgment, her nice sense of fitness, her restraint,
her fine irony, and the delicacy of her artistic touch, something must
be allowed for the hesitations and reservations which invariably beset
the critical pioneer.

To contend, however, for a moment that the present volume is Miss
Austen's greatest, as it was her first published, novel, would be a
mere exercise in paradox. There are, who swear by Persuasion; there
are, who prefer Emma and Mansfield Park; there is a large
contingent for Pride and Prejudice; and there is even a section
which advocates the pre-eminence of Northanger Abbey. But no one, as
far as we can remember, has ever put Sense and Sensibility first,[xii]
nor can we believe that its author did so herself. And yet it is she
herself who has furnished the standard by which we judge it, and it is
by comparison with Pride and Prejudice, in which the leading
characters are also two sisters, that we assess and depress its merit.
The Elinor and Marianne of Sense and Sensibility are only inferior
when they are contrasted with the Elizabeth and Jane of Pride and
Prejudice; and even then, it is probably because we personally like
the handsome and amiable Jane Bennet rather better than the obsolete
survival of the sentimental novel represented by Marianne Dashwood.
Darcy and Bingley again are much more 'likeable' (to use Lady
Queensberry's word) than the colourless Edward Ferrars and the
stiff-jointed Colonel Brandon. Yet it might not unfairly be contended
that there is more fidelity to what Mr. Thomas Hardy has termed
'life's little ironies' in Miss Austen's disposal of the two Miss
Dashwoods than there is in her disposal of the heroines of Pride and
Prejudice. Every one does not get a Bingley, or a Darcy (with a
park); but a good many sensible girls like Elinor pair off contentedly
with poor creatures like Edward Ferrars, while not a few enthusiasts
like Marianne decline at last upon middle-aged colonels with flannel
waistcoats. George Eliot, we fancy, would have held that the fates of
Elinor and Marianne were more probable than the fortunes of Jane and
Eliza Bennet. That, of the remaining characters, there is certainly
none to rival Mr. Bennet, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, or the
ineffable Mr. Collins, of Pride and Prejudice, is true; but we
confess to a kindness for vulgar matchmaking Mrs. Jennings with her
still-room 'parmaceti for an inward bruise' in the shape of a glass of
old Constantia; and for the diluted Squire Western, Sir John
Middleton, whose horror of being alone carries him to the point of
rejoicing in the acquisition of two to the population of London.[xiii]
Excellent again are Mr. Palmer and his wife; excellent, in their
sordid veracity, the self-seeking figures of the Miss Steeles. But the
pearls of the book must be allowed to be that egregious amateur in
toothpick-cases, Mr. Robert Ferrars (with his excursus in chapter
xxxvi. on life in a cottage), and the admirably-matched Mr. and Mrs.
John Dashwood. Miss Austen herself has never done anything better than
the inimitable and oft-quoted chapter wherein is debated between the
last-named pair the momentous matter of the amount to be devoted to
Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters; while the suggestion in chapters
xxxiii. and xxxiv. that the owner of Norland was once within some
thousands of having to sell out at a loss, deserves to be remembered
with that other memorable escape of Sir Roger de Coverley's ancestor,
who was only not killed in the civil wars because 'he was sent out of
the field upon a private message, the day before the battle of
Worcester.'

Of local colouring there is as little in Sense and Sensibility as in
Pride and Prejudice. It is not unlikely that some memories of
Steventon may survive in Norland; and it may be noted that there is
actually a Barton Place to the north of Exeter, not far from Lord
Iddesleigh's well-known seat of Upton Pynes. It is scarcely possible,
also, not to believe that, in Mrs. Jennings's description of
Delaford&mdash;'a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice
old-fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in
with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in
the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!'&mdash;Miss Austen had
in mind some real Hampshire or Devonshire country house. In any case,
it comes nearer a picture than what we usually get from her pen. 'Then
there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty
canal; and everything, in short, that one could wish for; and,
moreover,[xiv] it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the
carriages that pass along.' The last lines suggest those quaint
'gazebos' and alcoves, which, in the coaching days, were so often to
be found perched at the roadside, where one might sit and watch the
Dover or Canterbury stage go whirling by. Of genteel accomplishments
there is a touch In the 'landscape in coloured silks' which Charlotte
Palmer had worked at school (chap, xxvi.); and of old remedies for the
lost art of swooning, in the 'lavender drops' of chapter xxix. The
mention of a dance as a 'little hop' in chapter ix. reads like a
premature instance of middle Victorian slang. But nothing is new&mdash;even
in a novel&mdash;and 'hop,' in this sense, is at least as old as Joseph
Andrews.

CHAPTER I


The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate
was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of
their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single
man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his
life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her
death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great
alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and
received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood,
the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he
intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and
their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His
attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from
interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his existence.

By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present
lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own
marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his
wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent
of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that
property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the
remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her
child, and he had only a life-interest in it.



[2]The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every
other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so
unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew; but
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his son; but to his son, and his
son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way,
as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most
dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the
estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up
for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his
father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of
his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children
of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest
desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of
noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for
years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not
to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three
girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.

Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper
was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many
years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the
produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten
thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained
for his widow and daughters.

His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.
Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.

Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there
might prudently be in his power to do for them.
[3]

He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well
respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might
have been made still more respectable than he was: he might even have
been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and
very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature
of himself; more narrow-minded and selfish.

When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The
prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,
besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his
heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. "Yes, he would give
them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would
be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience." He
thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did
not repent.

No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,
arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her
right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his
father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common
feelings, must have been highly unpleasing. But in her mind there
was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any
offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a
source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a
favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no
opportunity, till the present, of showing them with how little
attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion
required it.

So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law[5] for it, that, on the
arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on
the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three
children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid
a breach with their brother.

Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and
enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence. She had an excellent heart; her disposition was
affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern
them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.

Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.
She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her
joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable,
interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great.

Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief
which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought
for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection
that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation
in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could
struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother,
could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with
proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.

Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl;
but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance,
without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair
to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.




[6]
CHAPTER II


Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her
mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.
As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them,
with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no
plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his
invitation was accepted.

A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,
no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater
degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.

Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How
could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child
too, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss
Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she
considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so
large an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever
supposed to exist between the children of any man by different
marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little
Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?

"It was my father's last request to me," replied her husband, "that I
should assist his widow and daughters."

"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he
was light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he
could not have thought of such a thing as[7] begging you to give away
half your fortune from your own child."

"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only
requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could
hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise,
I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.
The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something
must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new
home."

"Well, then, let something be done for them; but that something
need not be three thousand pounds. Consider," she added, "that when
the money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will
marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored
to our poor little boy&mdash;"

"Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, "that would make
great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for
instance, it would be a very convenient addition."

"To be sure it would."


"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were
diminished one half. Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes!"

"Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so
much for his sisters, even if really his sisters! And as it is&mdash;only
half blood! But you have such a generous spirit!"

"I would not wish to do any thing mean," he replied. "One had rather,
on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can
think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can
hardly expect more."

"There is no knowing what they may expect," said the lady, "but we
are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can
afford to do."

"Certainly; and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds
a-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have
about three thousand pounds on[8] their mother's death&mdash;a very
comfortable fortune for any young woman."

"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do
not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of
ten thousand pounds."

"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the
whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives, rather than for them&mdash;something of the annuity kind I
mean. My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.
A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."

His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this
plan.

"To be sure," said she, "it is better than parting with fifteen
hundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live
fifteen years we shall be completely taken in."

"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that
purchase."

"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and
healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it
comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You
are not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the
trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of
three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is
amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these
annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting
it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards
it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her
income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it;
and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money
would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any
restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities,
that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for
all the world."

"It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to have
those kind of yearly drains on one's income. One's[9] fortune, as your
mother justly says, is not one's own. To be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it
takes away one's independence."

"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think
themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises
no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at
my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."

"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty
pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my
father."

"To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,
and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever
they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther;
indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but
consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your
mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven
thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the
girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of
course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it.
Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what
on earth can four women want for more than that?&mdash;They will live so
cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no
carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no
company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only[10] conceive how
comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot
imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them
more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able
to give you something."

"Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are perfectly right.
My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described. When my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then."

"Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood. "But, however, one thing
must be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,
though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and
linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it."

"That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy
indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here."

"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for
any place they can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is.
Your father thought only of them And I must say this: that you owe
no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we
very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything
in the world to them."

This argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be
absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the
widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts
as his own wife pointed out.




CHAPTER III


Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced[11] for a while; for when
her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could
hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which
her mother would have approved.
[12]


&quot;I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it.&quot;


Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise
on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her
daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her
in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own
heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to
his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His
attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that
their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied
on the liberality of his intentions.

The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character, which half a year's residence in her family
afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or
maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might
have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a
particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility,
according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters'
continuance at Norland.

This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing young
man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's
establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there.[13]

Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,
that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
It was contrary to every doctrine of her's that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.

Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident
to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,
his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.
His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid
improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him
distinguished as&mdash;they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to
interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John
Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for
great men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising.

Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed
conversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther,
by a reflection[14] which Elinor chanced one day to make on the
difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which
recommended him most forcibly to her mother.

"It is enough," said she; "to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.
It implies everything amiable. I love him already."

"I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when you know more of him."

"Like him!" replied her mother with a smile. "I feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love."

"You may esteem him."

"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love."

Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners
were attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily
comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his
worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was
no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his
temper affectionate.

No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

"In a few months, my dear Marianne," said she, "Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but she will be
happy."

"Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without her?"

"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few
miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will
gain a brother&mdash;a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest
opinion in the world of Edward's heart. But you look grave, Marianne;
do you disapprove your sister's choice?"

"Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it with some surprise.
Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet&mdash;he is not
the kind of young man; there is something wanting&mdash;his figure is not
striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man
who could seriously attach[15] my sister. His eyes want all that spirit,
that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides
all this, I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste. Music seems
scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings very
much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while
she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. He admires as
a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be
united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the
same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how
spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!
I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much
composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my
seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such
dreadful indifference!"

"He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant
prose. I thought so at the time; but you would give him Cowper."

"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!&mdash;but we must allow
for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she
may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke my
heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He
must have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners must
ornament his goodness with every possible charm."

"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in
life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate
than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your
destiny be different from her's!"




[16]
CHAPTER IV


"What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne, "that Edward should have
no taste for drawing."

"No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? He
does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of
improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he
would have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such
matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on
any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste,
which in general direct him perfectly right."

Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by
the drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous
delight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet,
though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister
for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.

"I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you do not consider him as
deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if that were
your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him."

Marianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of
her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was
impossible. At length she replied:

"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his
inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion
in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that
is worthy and amiable."

"I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile, "that his dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as[17] that. I do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly."

Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.

"Of his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, I
think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in
unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.
But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I
have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I
have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard
his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,
I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of
books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just
and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.
At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person
can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which
are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is
perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really
handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?"

"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When
you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
in his face, than I now do in his heart."

Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she
had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood
very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but
she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her
mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next&mdash;that with them,
to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain
the real state of the case to her sister.

"I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly of
him&mdash;that I greatly esteem, that I like him."

Marianne here burst forth with indignation[18]&mdash;

"Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than
cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I
will leave the room this moment."

Elinor could not help laughing. "Excuse me," said she; "and be assured
that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;
believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the
suspicion&mdash;the hope&mdash;of his affection for me may warrant, without
imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am
by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the
extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known,
you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own
partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I
feel little&mdash;scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other
points to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from
being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from
Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never
been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if
Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a
great fortune or high rank."

Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
and herself had outstripped the truth.

"And you really are not engaged to him!" said she. "Yet it certainly
soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I
shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity
of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must
be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he
should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw
himself, how delightful it would be!"

Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not
consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as
Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about
him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something
almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel
it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to
produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more
reasonable cause[19] might be found in the dependent situation which
forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother
neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present,
nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself,
without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With
such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on
the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his
preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as
certain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed
the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes,
she believed it to be no more than friendship.

But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when
perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time,
(which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first
opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking
to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.
Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in, that
Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to
be calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and
instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.

In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the
post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the
offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of
her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The
letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a
dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a
cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she
might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly
pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to
come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own
residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton
Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any
alteration, be made comfortable to her. He[20] seemed really anxious to
accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so
friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin;
more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and
unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for
deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The
situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as
Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a
sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to
the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood
of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a
blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her
daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved
place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a
woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her
acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;
and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters, that she
might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.

Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance. On that head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose
her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as
described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either
point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any
charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of
Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother
from sending a letter of acquiescence.




CHAPTER V


No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged
herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife
that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no
longer than till every thing were[21] ready for her inhabiting it. They
heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her
husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland.
She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into
Devonshire. Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and,
in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to
her, repeated, "Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from
hence! And to what part of it?" She explained the situation. It was
within four miles northward of Exeter.

"It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of my
friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will
find none in accommodating them."

She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John
Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still
greater affection. Though her late conversation with her
daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer
than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her
in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and
Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to
show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother,
how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.

Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly
sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from
Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her
furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for
the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his
promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.
The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of
household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte
of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh:
she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income
would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any
handsome article of furniture.

Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready
furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty
arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the
disposal of her effects at Norland, and to[22] determine her future
household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was
exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested
her, was soon done. The horses which were left her by her husband had
been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of
disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the
earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her
children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept
it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. Her wisdom too limited
the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom
they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their
establishment at Norland.

The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into
Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as
Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred
going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and
she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as
to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her
own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from
diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the
prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted
to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.
Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might
with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do
it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be
looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs.
Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be
convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his
assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months
at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of
housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man
of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to,
that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to
have any design of giving money away.

In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's
first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their
future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin
their journey.[23]

Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved. "Dear, dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wandered
alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there;
"when shall I cease to regret you!&mdash;when learn to feel a home
elsewhere! Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now
viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no
more! And you, ye well-known trees!&mdash;but you will continue the same.
No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become
motionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will
continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you
occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your
shade! But who will remain to enjoy you?"




CHAPTER VI


The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they
drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a
country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a
view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It
was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After
winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A
small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat
wicket gate admitted them into it.

As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;
but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the
roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were
the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly
through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance
was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were
the offices and the stairs. Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the
rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good
repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!&mdash;but
the tears which recollection[24] called forth as they entered the house
were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on
their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear
happy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from
first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they
received an impression in its favour which was of material service in
recommending it to their lasting approbation.

The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately
behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open
downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was
chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the
cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it
commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country
beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley
in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it
branched out again between two of the steepest of them.

With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the
whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered
many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was
a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to
supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. "As
for the house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our
family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the
present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in
the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may
think about building. These parlors are both too small for such
parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I
have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with
perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other
for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily
added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug
little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must
not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult
matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the
world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly."

In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a[25] woman who never
saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the
house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their
particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and
other possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte
was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were
affixed to the walls of their sitting room.

In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after
breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called
to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from
his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be
deficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He
had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young
cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured;
and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their
arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to
be an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest
desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and
pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they
were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried
to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give
offence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour
after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit
arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by
a present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their
letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the
satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.

Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her
intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured
that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was
answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced
to them the next day.
[26]


So shy before company.


They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her
appearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more
than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall
and striking, and her [27]address graceful. Her manners had all the
elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have been improved
by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long
enough to detract something from their first admiration, by showing
that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had
nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or
remark.

Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and
Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her
their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which
means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in
case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire
his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him,
while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise
of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as
he could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child
ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the
present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were
most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled
either, for of course every body differed, and every body was
astonished at the opinion of the others.

An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on
the rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house
without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.




CHAPTER VII


Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had
passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from
their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large
and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance. The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter
for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends
staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every
kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary[28] to
the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward
behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with
such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a
sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she
humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady
Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all
the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in
existence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and
abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and
education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise
to the good breeding of his wife.

Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of
all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her
greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John's
satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting
about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier
they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the
juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever
forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in
winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who
was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen.

The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants
he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were
young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good
opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his
disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation
might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In
showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his
cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,
though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is
not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
residence within his own manor.

Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of[29] the house by
Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;
and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day
before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They
would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a
particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither
very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness
of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.
He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring
some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was
full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at
Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable
woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as
they might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were
perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and
wished for no more.

Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,
fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and
rather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was
vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor
to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave
Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery
as Mrs. Jennings's.

Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by
resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be
his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother. He was
silent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite
of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old
bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though
his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his
address was particularly gentlemanlike.

There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton
was so particularly repulsive,[30] that in comparison of it the gravity
of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his
mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to
enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after
dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to
every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.

In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was
invited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to
be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went
through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in
the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated
that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she
had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.

Marianne's performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his
admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation
with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently
called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be
diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a
particular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon
alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid
her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him
on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their
shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not
to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,
was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of
the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five
and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
exquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every
allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity
required.




[31]
CHAPTER VIII


Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two
daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and
she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as
far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady
by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of
discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to
pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne
Dashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening
of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she
sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons'
dining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to
her again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would
be an excellent match, for he was rich, and she was handsome. Mrs.
Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever
since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;
and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty
girl.

The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for
it supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she
laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former
her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,
perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,
for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's
advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.

Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than
herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to[32] the youthful fancy
of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability
of wishing to throw ridicule on his age.

"But at least, Mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,
though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon
is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be
my father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must
have long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!
When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not
protect him?"

"Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can
easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use
of his limbs!"

"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life?"

"My dearest child," said her mother, laughing, "at this rate you must
be in continual terror of my decay; and it must seem to you a
miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty."

"Mamma, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel
Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of
losing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer.
But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony."

"Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I
should not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to
his marrying her ."

"A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne, after pausing a moment,
"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be
uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might
bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of
convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be
no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem
only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at
the expense of the other."[33]

"It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor, "to convince you
that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five
anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to
her. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to
the constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced
to complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic
feel in one of his shoulders."

"But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; "and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,
rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble."

"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him
half so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"

Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, "Mamma," said
Marianne, "I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot
conceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now
been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else
can detain him at Norland?"

"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?" said Mrs. Dashwood. "I had
none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want
of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of
his coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?"

"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must."

"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber, she
observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not
likely that the room would be wanted for some time."

"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was
no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an
affectionate[34] brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most
unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting
Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is
invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to
avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"




CHAPTER IX


The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding
them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far
greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss
of their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for
the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much
occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them
always employed.

Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in
spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at
their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the
wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who
could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.
About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding
valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly
described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered
an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a
little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to
be better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its
possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.

The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The[35] high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their
superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and
Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the
partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the
confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had
occasioned. The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others
from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration
that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud
would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off
together.

They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations.

"Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior to
this?&mdash;Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."

Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind,
resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer,
when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain
set full in their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged,
though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their
own house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,&mdash;it was that of
running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
led immediately to their garden gate.

They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step
brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop
herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached
the bottom in safety.

A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her
accident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She
had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in
her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered
his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what[36] her
situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther
delay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden,
the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly
into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his
hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.

Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and
while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a
secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he
apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so
frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome,
received additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been
even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs.
Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child;
but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to
the action which came home to her feelings.

She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address
which always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he
declined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know
to whom she was obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his
present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him
the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The
honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself
still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.

His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised
against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior
attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the
rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting
her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their
entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the
admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her
praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the
house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of
thought which[37] particularly recommended the action to her. Every
circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his
residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her
imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded.

Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident
being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any
gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.

"Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "what, is he in the country? That is
good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on
Thursday."

"You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.

"Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year."

"And what sort of a young man is he?"

"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent
shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."

"And is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne, indignantly.
"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his
pursuits, his talents, and genius?"

Sir John was rather puzzled.

"Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much about him as to all
that. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the
nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with
him today?"

But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.
Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his
mind.

"But who is he?" said Elinor. "Where does he come from? Has he a house
at Allenham?"

On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he
told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the
country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady
at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he
was to inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I
can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own
in[38] Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up
to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss
Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will
be jealous, if she does not take care."

"I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,
"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of
my daughters towards what you call catching him. It is not an
employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with
us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what
you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose
acquaintance will not be ineligible."

"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived," repeated
Sir John. "I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he
danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down."

"Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, "and with
elegance, with spirit?"

"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert."

"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever
be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and
leave him no sense of fatigue."

"Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir John, "I see how it will
be. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor
Brandon."

"That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne, warmly, "which I
particularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit
is intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'
are the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and
if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity."

Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as
heartily as if he did, and then replied&mdash;

"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.
Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth
setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling
about and spraining of ankles."




[39]
CHAPTER X


Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,
styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to
make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with
more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him
and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the
visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,
and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
him. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview
to be convinced.

Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a
remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,
though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of
height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in
the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was
less violently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown,
but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant;
her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in
her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an
eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From
Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the
embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But
when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw
that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united
frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,
that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such
a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to
herself for the rest of his stay.

It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her
to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and
she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that[40]
related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his
opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her
favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so
rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have
been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the
excellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was
strikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by
each; or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no
longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her
eyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught
all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they
conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.

"Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "for one
morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already
ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of
importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are
certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have
received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.
But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to
explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages,
and then you can have nothing farther to ask."

"Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too
happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of
decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful:&mdash;had I talked only of the
weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
reproach would have been spared."

"My love," said her mother, "you must not be offended with Elinor&mdash;she
was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend." Marianne was softened in a moment.

Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure[41] in their
acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He
came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his
excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day
gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had
ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. She was
confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement
been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick
imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was
exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he
joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind
which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and
which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.

His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,
they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were
considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which
Edward had unfortunately wanted.

In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's;
and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too
much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons
or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other
people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of
undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too
easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution
which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne
could say in its support.

Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her
ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was
all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour
declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities
were strong.
[42]


They sang together.


Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before
the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and
Willoughby. [43]

Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so
early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to
Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit
were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the
other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his
feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to
sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that
the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own
satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that
however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might
forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking
opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel
Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five
and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty?
and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him
indifferent. She liked him&mdash;in spite of his gravity and reserve, she
beheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were
mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of
spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped
hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief
of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and
compassion.

Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted
by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being
neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.

"Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when they
were talking of him together, "whom every body speaks well of, and
nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody
remembers to talk to."

"That is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne.

"Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor, "for it is injustice in
both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and
I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him."

"That he is patronised by you," replied Willoughby, "is certainly in
his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in
itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as Lady Middleton and[44] Mrs. Jennings, that could command the
indifference of any body else?"

"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will
make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their
praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more
undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."

"In defence of your prot&eacute;g&eacute; you can even be saucy."

"My prot&eacute;g&eacute;, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will
always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between
thirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been
abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of
giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always
answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good
nature."

"That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, "he has told you,
that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are
troublesome."

"He would have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such
inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been
previously informed."

"Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins."

"I may venture to say that his observations have stretched much
further than your candour. But why should you dislike him?"

"I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very
respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;
who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to
employ, and two new coats every year."

"Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has neither genius, taste,
nor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no
ardour, and his voice no expression."

"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass," replied Elinor,
"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and
insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,
well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an
amiable heart."[45]

"Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using me unkindly. You
are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my
will. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be
artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel
Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he
has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade
him to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you,
however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other
respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for
an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me
the privilege of disliking him as much as ever."




CHAPTER XI


Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first
came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy
their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have
such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them
little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When
Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad,
which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution.
The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water
were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.
In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the
Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,
in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her
affection.

Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished
that it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne
abhorred all concealment where no[46] real disgrace could attend
unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in
themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary
effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and
mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at
all times, was an illustration of their opinions.

When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he
did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the
rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the
amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when
obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand
together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made
them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not
shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.

Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young
and ardent mind.

This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to
Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with
her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought
it possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her
present home.

Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at
ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded
her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,
nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than
ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the
conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting
talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which
ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated
her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory
been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very
early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last
illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.
Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more
silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve[47]
was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.
Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and
intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had
nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her
insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same;
and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband,
provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest
children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment
from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; and so
little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any
share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of
her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.

In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities,
excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.
Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even
her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his
attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her sister.

Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.
This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from
him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on
Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint
smile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
attachments."

"No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all romantic."

"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist."

"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on
the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know
not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable
basis of common sense and observation;[48] and then they may be more easy
to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself."

"This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."

"I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor. "There are
inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look
forward to as her greatest possible advantage."

After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying&mdash;

"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a
second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the
inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"

"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minuti&aelig; of her principles.
I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second
attachment's being pardonable."

"This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change, a total change of
sentiments&mdash;No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic
refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently
are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too
dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper
and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like
her, but who from an enforced change&mdash;from a series of unfortunate
circumstances&mdash;" Here he stopped suddenly; appeared to think that he
had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,
which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head. The lady would
probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss
Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it
was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion
with the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more.
But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole
story[49] would have been speedily formed under her active imagination;
and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous
love.




CHAPTER XII


As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of
all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,
with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one
that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was
not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter
her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the
servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and
told her sister of it in raptures.

"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,"
she added, "and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall
share its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs."

Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for
some time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,
the expense would be a trifle; Mamma she was sure would never object
to it; and any horse would do for him; he might always get one at
the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor
then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present
from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too
much.

"You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know very
little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much
better acquainted with him, than I am[50] with any other creature in the
world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy; it is disposition alone. Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."

Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her
sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for
her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she
consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw
him next, that it must be declined.

She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the
cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to
him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his
present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side
impossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after
expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, "But,
Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I
shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall
receive you."

This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the
sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her
sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so
decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between
them. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each
other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she,
or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to
discover it by accident.

Margaret related something to her the next day, which[51] placed this
matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the
parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for
observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to
her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.

"Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret to tell you about
Marianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon."

"You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost every day since they first
met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I
believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round
her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle."

"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be
married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair."

"Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of
his."

"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I
saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out
of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as
could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently
he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it
was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a
piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book."

For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.

Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the
park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular
favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,
Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, "I must not
tell, may I, Elinor?"

This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.
But the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.[52]



He cut off a long lock of her hair.
[53]

Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good
to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
Margaret&mdash;

"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to
repeat them."

"I never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret; "it was you
who told me of it yourself."

This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more.

"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it," said Mrs.
Jennings. "What is the gentleman's name?"

"I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I know
where he is too."

"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be
sure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say."

"No, that he is not. He is of no profession at all."

"Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth, "you know that all this
is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in
existence."

"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such
a man once, and his name begins with an F."

Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
moment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her
ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was
immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked
Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so
easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.

A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see
a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a
brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not
be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict
orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,
and Sir John, who was[54] particularly warm in their praise, might be
allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit
them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They
contained a noble piece of water&mdash;a sail on which was to a form a
great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be
taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted
in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.

To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight; and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.




CHAPTER XIII


Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
what Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through,
fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate,
for they did not go at all.

By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they
were to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had
rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,
and the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and
good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the
greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.

While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the
rest there was one for Colonel Brandon:&mdash;he took it, looked at the
direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.

"What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.

Nobody could tell.

"I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton. "It must be
something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly."

In about five minutes he returned.

"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he
entered the room.

"None at all, ma'am, I thank you."[55]

"Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse."

"No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business."

"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a
letter of business? Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear
the truth of it."

"My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect what you are saying."

"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?" said
Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof.

"No, indeed, it is not."

"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well."

"Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring a little.

"Oh! you know who I mean."

"I am particularly sorry, ma'am," said he, addressing Lady Middleton,
"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town."

"In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings. "What can you have to do in town at
this time of year?"

"My own loss is great," he continued, "in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell."

What a blow upon them all was this!

"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," said
Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"

He shook his head.

"We must go," said Sir John. "It shall not be put off when we are so
near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."

"I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day!"

"If you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs.
Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not."

"You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby, "if you were to
defer your journey till our return."

"I cannot afford to lose one hour."[56]

Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, "There
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of
them. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his own writing."

"I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.

"There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of
old," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on anything. But,
however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the
two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked
up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his
usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."

Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable.

"Well, then, when will you come back again?"

"I hope we shall see you at Barton," added her ladyship, "as soon as
you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to
Whitwell till you return."

"You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in
my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all."

"Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir John. "If he is not here
by the end of the week, I shall go after him."

"Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then perhaps you may
find out what his business is."

"I do not want to pry into other men's concerns. I suppose it is
something he is ashamed of."

Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.

"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?" added Sir John.

"No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post."

"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you
had better change your mind."

"I assure you it is not in my power."

He then took leave of the whole party.

"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter, Miss Dashwood?"

"I am afraid, none at all."

[57]"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to
do."

To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.

"Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before you go, do let us know
what you are going about."

He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the
room.

The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.

"I can guess what his business is, however," said Mrs. Jennings
exultingly.

"Can you, ma'am?" said almost every body.

"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."

"And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.

"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a
very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
young ladies." Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,
"She is his natural daughter."

"Indeed!"

"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel
will leave her all his fortune."

When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as
they were all got together, they must do something by way of being
happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The
carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne
never looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the
park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of
them was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the
return of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive;
but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while
the others went on the downs.

It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,[58] and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the
Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down
nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great
contentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder
Miss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had
not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and
said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, "I have found you
out in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning."

Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, "Where, pray?"

"Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that we had been out in my
curricle?"

"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined
to find out where you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss
Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,
I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when
I was there six years ago."

Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed
heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they
had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.
Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that
they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house.

Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very
unlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter
the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the
smallest acquaintance.

As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;
and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance
related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry
with her for doubting it.

"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself?"

"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and
with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby."
[59]


&quot;I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.&quot;


"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to
show that house; and as he went in an open [60]carriage, it was
impossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter
morning in my life."

"I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety."

"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for
if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have
been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."

"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct?"

"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our
lives. I value not her censure any more than I should do her
commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in
walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. They will
one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and&mdash;"

"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be
justified in what you have done."

She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;
and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her
sister again, and said with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it
was rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby
wanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house,
I assure you. There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs;
of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture
it would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two
sides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the
house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view
of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills
that we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for
nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture; but if it were newly
fitted up&mdash;a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it
one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England."

Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the
others, she would have described every room in the house with equal
delight.




[61]
CHAPTER XIV


The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with
his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised
the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great
wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with
little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there
must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that
could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not
escape them all.

"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she.
"I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances
may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do
think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else
can it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know
the truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I
dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.
May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I
have a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is
about Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed
in his circumstances now, for he is a very prudent man, and to be
sure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can
be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.
His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him
out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the
bargain."

So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly
away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides
that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting
amazement or variety[62] of speculation, her wonder was otherwise
disposed of. It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her
sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be
peculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every
day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the
disposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her
mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other
declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.

She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no
reason to believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at
about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which
that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained
of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by
them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at
all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to
their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered
her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to
prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.

Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than
Willoughby's behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many
more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general
engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his
favourite pointer at her feet.

One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the
country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening
to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he
warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had
established as perfect with him.

"What!" he exclaimed, "Improve this dear cottage! No. [63]That I will
never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch
to its size, if my feelings are regarded."

"Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will be
done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it."

"I am heartily glad of it," he cried. "May she always be poor, if she
can employ her riches no better."

"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one
whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in
the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it?"

"I am," said he. "To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I
rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again
in the exact plan of this cottage."

"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," said
Elinor.

"Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thing
belonging to it&mdash;in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,
should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under
such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at
Barton."

"I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this."

"There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, "which might
greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of
my affection, which no other can possibly share."

Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she
understood him.

"How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this time
twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one
should live in it. How[64] little did I then think that the very first
news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,
would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate
satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of
prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account
for. Must it not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a lowered
voice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this house
you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by
imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,
and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
could possibly afford."

Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted.

"You are a good woman," he warmly replied. "Your promise makes me easy.
Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me that not
only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and
yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider
me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear
to me."

The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.

"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was
leaving them. "I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must
walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."

He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.




[65]
CHAPTER XV


Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and
two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from
being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her
mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the
night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly
satisfied with her remaining at home.

On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and
servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced
that her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had
foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had
taught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne
came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with
her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had
just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning
against the mantelpiece with his back towards them. He turned round
on their coming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly
partook of the emotion which overpowered Marianne.

"Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she
entered:&mdash;"is she ill?"

"I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced
smile presently added, "It is I who may rather expect to be ill&mdash;for I
am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!"

"Disappointment?"

"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has
this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my
dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of
exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you."

"To London!&mdash;and are you going this morning?"

"Almost this moment."

[66]



Apparently in violent affliction.

[67]
"This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged, and her
business will not detain you from us long I hope."

He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind, but I have no idea of
returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are
never repeated within the twelvemonth."

"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the
neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can
you wait for an invitation here?"

His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only
replied, "You are too good."

Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal
amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first
spoke.

"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you
will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here
immediately, because you only can judge how far that might be
pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed
to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination."

"My engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, "are of
such a nature&mdash;that&mdash;I dare not flatter myself&mdash;"

He stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and
another pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with
a faint smile, "It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not
torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it
is impossible for me now to enjoy."

He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him
step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.

Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the
parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
sudden departure occasioned.

Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. She thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour
in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of
cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's
invitation&mdash;a backwardness[68] so unlike a lover, so unlike
himself&mdash;greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious
design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some
unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister. The
distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious
quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered
what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.

But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her
sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the
tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all
probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and
encouraging as a duty.

In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were
red, her countenance was not uncheerful.

"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor," said she,
as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart does he travel?"

"It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work
of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so
affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice,&mdash;gone too
without intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us
must have happened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.
You must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can
they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness
to accept your invitation here?"

"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see
that. He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all
over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you."

"Can you, indeed!"

"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but
you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can&mdash;it will not satisfy
you, I know; but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it. I am
persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,
disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and
on that account is eager to get him away; and that the business which
she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss[69]
him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware
that she does disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at
present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels
himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her
schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell
me, I know, that this may or may not have happened; but I will
listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of
understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor,
what have you to say?"

"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."

"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have
happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had
rather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for
misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology
for the latter. You are resolved to think him blamable, because he
took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has
shown. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits
depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be
accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to
the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the
world to think ill of?&mdash;to the possibility of motives unanswerable in
themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all,
what is it you suspect him of?"

"I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is
the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
in him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of
the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be
candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have
very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.
But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at
once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at
its being practiced by him."

"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where
the deviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of
what I have said in his defence?&mdash;I am happy&mdash;and he is acquitted."[70]

"Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they
are engaged) from Mrs. Smith; and if that is the case, it must be
highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at
present. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."

"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and
Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have
been reproaching them every day for incautiousness."

"I want no proof of their affection," said Elinor; "but of their
engagement I do."

"I am perfectly satisfied of both."

"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of
them."

"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has
not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last
fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future
wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been
daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate
respect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How
could such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that
Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should
leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of
his affection,&mdash;that they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence?"

"I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance except one is
in favour of their engagement; but that one is the total silence of
both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other."

"How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,
if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the
nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a
part in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him
really indifferent to her?"

"No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure."

"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such
indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to
him."

[71]"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this
matter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are
fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we
find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed."

"A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you
would suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I
require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly
open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. It must be
Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of
honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to
create alarm? can he be deceitful?"

"I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor. "I love Willoughby,
sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will
not encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his
manners this morning; he did not speak like himself, and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be
explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He
had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest
affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away
for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part
by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a
case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more
to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general
character;&mdash;but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct
on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,
or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent."

"You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
suspected. Though we have not known him long, he is no stranger in
this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?
Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,
it might have been odd that he should leave us without[72] acknowledging
everything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an
engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage
must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it
can be observed, may now be very advisable."

They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to
acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.

They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the
room and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes
were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then
restrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could
neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently
pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of
fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.

This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She
was without any power, because she was without any desire of command
over herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby
overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most
anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if
they spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings
connected with him.




CHAPTER XVI


Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She
would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next
morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than
when she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the
whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with a
headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
giving pain every moment to her mother and[73] sisters, and forbidding
all attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent
enough!

When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about
the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.

The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played
over every favourite song that she had been used to play to
Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined,
and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had
written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther
sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day
applied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing
and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books
too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast
between the past and present was certain of giving. She read nothing
but what they had been used to read together.

Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these
employments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and
silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as
lively as ever.

No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.
Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.
Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at
least satisfied herself.

"Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often Sir John fetches our
letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
Sir John's hands."

Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so
direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she
could not help suggesting it to her mother.[74]

"Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or
she is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind,
so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would
be the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all
unreserve, and to you more especially."

"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible
that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never
deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know
Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall
not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances
make the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."

Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister's
youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common
care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic
delicacy.

It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before
Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed,
were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;
but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of
Shakespeare, exclaimed&mdash;

"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went
away before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he
comes again&mdash;; But it may be months, perhaps, before that happens."

"Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise. "No&mdash;nor many weeks."

Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor
pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.

One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was
prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of
wandering away by herself. Hitherto she[75] had carefully avoided every
companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the
downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of
the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never
be found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the
exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Marianne's mind could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied
with gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the
entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less
wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had
travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching
that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect
which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot
which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.

Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated
one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes
they could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment
afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed&mdash;

"It is he; it is indeed&mdash;I know it is!" and was hastening to meet him,
when Elinor cried out&mdash;

"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The
person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air."

"He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure he has. His air, his
coat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come."

She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne
from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being
Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon
within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart
sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back,
when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a
third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging
her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome
Edward Ferrars.
[76]


Begging her to stop.


He was the only person in the world who could at that [77]moment be
forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained
a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on him, and
in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.

He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with
them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.

He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him
than even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between
Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable
coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual
behaviour. On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency
of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was
confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked
neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by
questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a
dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her,
by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.

After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,
he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.

"A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the
same county with Elinor without seeing her before.

He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with
some friends near Plymouth.

"Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor.

"I was at Norland about a month ago."

"And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Marianne.

"Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year&mdash;the woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves."

"Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting sensation have I
formerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see
them driven in showers about me by the wind! What[78] feelings have they,
the season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard
them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven
as much as possible from the sight."

"It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has your passion for dead
leaves."

"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But
sometimes they are." As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a
few moments; but rousing herself again, "Now, Edward," said she,
calling his attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley. Look up
to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever
see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and
plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that
farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."

"It is a beautiful country," he replied; "but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter."

"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?"

"Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the objects before
me, I see a very dirty lane."

"How strange!" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.

"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant
people?"

"No, not all," answered Marianne; "we could not be more unfortunately
situated."

"Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you say so? How can you be so
unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards
us have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne,
how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"

"No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many painful moments."

Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their
visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by
talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &amp;c. extorting
from him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve
mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to
regulate her[79] behaviour to him by the past rather than the present,
she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated
him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.




CHAPTER XVII


Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his
coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.
Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received
the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he
entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her;
and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like
himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his
interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in
spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was
attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family
perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents.

"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?" said she,
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; "are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself?"

"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents
than inclination for a public life!"

"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no
affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find
it a difficult matter."

"I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have
every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence."

"You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate."[80]

"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body
else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so."

"Strange that it would!" cried Marianne. "What have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness?"

"Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do
with it."

"Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can
afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned."

"Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point.
Your competence and my wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and
without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every
kind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more
noble than mine. Come, what is your competence?"

"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than that."

Elinor laughed. "Two thousand a year! One is my wealth! I guessed
how it would end."

"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said
Marianne. "A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure
I am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of
servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on
less."

Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at Combe Magna.

"Hunters!" repeated Edward; "but why must you have hunters? Every body
does not hunt."

Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most people do."

"I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebody
would give us all a large fortune a-piece!"

"Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with
animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness.

"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth."

"Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be! I wonder what I
should do with it!"

[81]Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.

"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs.
Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help."

"You must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor,
"and your difficulties will soon vanish."

"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,"
said Edward, "in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,
music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you&mdash;and as
for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music
enough in London to content her. And books!&mdash;Thomson, Cowper,
Scott&mdash;she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up
every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;
and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old
twisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very
saucy. But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old
disputes."

"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward&mdash;whether it be melancholy
or gay, I love to recall it&mdash;and you will never offend me by talking
of former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be
spent; some of it, at least&mdash;my loose cash&mdash;would certainly be
employed in improving my collection of music and books."

"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs."

"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it."

"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their life&mdash;for your opinion on that
point is unchanged, I presume?"

"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is
not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."

"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she is not
at all altered."

"She is only grown a little more grave than she was."

"Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me. You are not
very gay yourself."

[82]"Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh. "But gaiety never
was a part of my character."

"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's," said Elinor; "I should
hardly call her a lively girl&mdash;she is very earnest, very eager in all
she does&mdash;sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation&mdash;but
she is not often really merry."

"I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always set her
down as a lively girl."

"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said
Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."

"But I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, "to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has
always been your doctrine, I am sure."

"No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess,
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?"

"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility," said Edward to Elinor, "Do you gain no ground?"

"Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at
Marianne.

"My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the question; but
I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's. I never wish to
offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought
that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!"[83]

"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers," said
Elinor.

"She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward.
"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful, I should not be shy."

"But you would still be reserved," said Marianne, "and that is worse."

Edward started. "Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"

"Yes, very."

"I do not understand you," replied he, colouring. "Reserved!&mdash;how, in
what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?"

Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the
subject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as
rapturously as herself?"

Edward made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him
in their fullest extent&mdash;and he sat for some time silent and dull.




CHAPTER XVIII


Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His
visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was
unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still
distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no
doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference
seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her
contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the
preceding one.

He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning
before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as[84] she could, soon left them to
themselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour
door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself
come out.

"I am going into the village to see my horses," said he, "as you are
not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently."



Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher
situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole,
which had exceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured
Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe her own
admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the
objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her
by saying, "You must not enquire too far, Marianne: remember I have no
knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance
and want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep,
which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to
be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought
only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.
You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I
call it a very fine country,&mdash;the hills are steep, the woods seem full
of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug,&mdash;with rich
meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It
exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty
with utility&mdash;and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you
admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and
promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.
I know nothing of the picturesque."

"I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne; "but why should you
boast of it?"

"I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation,
Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater
indifference and less discrimination[85] in viewing them himself than he
possesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."

"It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape
scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries
to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I
have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning."

"I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight
in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your
sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine
prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked,
twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall,
straight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I
am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more
pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower,&mdash;and a troop of
tidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the
world."

Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her
sister. Elinor only laughed.

The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained
thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.
She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,
his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a
plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.

"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried. "Is that
Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should
have thought her hair had been darker."

Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt; but when she saw
how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of
thought could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and
giving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's
hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know."

Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair
was her own, she instantaneously felt as well[86] satisfied as Marianne;
the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and
affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all
doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.

Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.
Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own
forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little
offence it had given her sister.

Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of
his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name
of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of
raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of
their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being
immediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very
significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's
instructions, extended.

Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.
On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their
visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,
he wished to engage them for both.

"You must drink tea with us to night," said he, "for we shall be
quite alone; and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we
shall be a large party."

Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. "And who knows but you may raise
a dance," said she. "And that will tempt you, Miss Marianne."

"A dance!" cried Marianne. "Impossible! Who is to dance?"
[87]


Came to take a survey of the guest.


"Who? why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers [88]to be sure.
What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that
shall be nameless is gone!"

"I wish with all my soul," cried Sir John, "that Willoughby were among
us again."

This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. "And who
is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he
was sitting.

She gave him a brief reply. Marianne's countenance was more
communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning
of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him
before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round
her, and said, in a whisper, "I have been guessing. Shall I tell you
my guess?"

"What do you mean?"

"Shall I tell you."

"Certainly."

"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."

Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said&mdash;

"Oh, Edward! How can you?&mdash;But the time will come I hope&mdash;I am sure
you will like him."

"I do not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness
and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of
her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing
between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to
mention it.




CHAPTER XIX


Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by
Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on
self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment
among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two
or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved&mdash;he
grew more and more partial to the house and environs&mdash;never spoke of
going away without a sigh&mdash;declared his time to be wholly
disengaged&mdash;even[89] doubted to what place he should go when he left
them&mdash;but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly&mdash;he
could hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other
things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the
lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being
in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their
kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being
with them. Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of
their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.

Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his
mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,
and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain
behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to
regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous
qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from
her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of
openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want
of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's
disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of
his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered
inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his
mother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will,
parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad
to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to
yield, when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty
to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for
comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the
remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from
him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it
which he constantly wore round his finger.

"I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the
last morning, "you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some
inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it&mdash;you would
not be[90] able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you
would be materially benefited in one particular at least&mdash;you would
know where to go when you left them."

"I do assure you," he replied, "that I have long thought on this
point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always
be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to
engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing
like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of
my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never
could agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the
church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.
They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The
law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers
in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and
drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for
the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family
approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too
old when the subject was first started to enter it; and, at length, as
there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might
be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one,
idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and
honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly
bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do
nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle
ever since."

"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be," said Mrs. Dashwood,
"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons
will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and
trades as Columella's."

"They will be brought up," said he, in a serious accent, "to be as
unlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in
every thing."

"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,
Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike
yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from
friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their
education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but
patience&mdash;or give it a[91] more fascinating name, call it hope. Your
mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so
anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her
happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.
How much may not a few months do?"

"I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy many months to produce any
good to me."

This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to
Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which
shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's
feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.
But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his
going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by
seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different
as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.

Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the
house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost
as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this
conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her account.

Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no
more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.
The business of self-command she settled very easily;&mdash;with strong
affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.
That her sister's affections were calm, she dared not deny, though
she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she
gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that
sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.

Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible
variety which the different[92] state of her spirits at different times
could produce,&mdash;with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and
doubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of
her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,
conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude
was produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could
not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so
interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross
her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.

From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was
roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival
of company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little
gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew
her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the
door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,
but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite
unknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir
John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to
open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short
between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to
speak at one without being heard at the other.

"Well," said he, "we have brought you some strangers. How do you like
them?"

"Hush! they will hear you."

"Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very
pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way."

As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without
taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.

"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her
instrument is open."

"She is walking, I believe."

They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to
wait till the door was opened before she told her story. She came
hallooing to the window, "How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.
Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be
glad[93] of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son
and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I
thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,
but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of
nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again;
so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is
Colonel Brandon come back again&mdash;"

Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to
receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two
strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same
time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs.
Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into
the parlour, attended by Sir John.

Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally
unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very
pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,
but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile,
smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled
when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five
or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his
wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the
room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies,
without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their
apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read
it as long as he stayed.

Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with
a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before
her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.

"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so
charming! Only think, Mamma, how it is improved since I was here last!
I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs.
Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how
delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!
Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"[94]

Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from
the newspaper.

"Mr. Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing; "he never does
sometimes. It is so ridiculous!"

This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to
find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking
with surprise at them both.

Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and
continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing
their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer
laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every
body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an
agreeable surprise.

"You may believe how glad we all were to see them," added Mrs.
Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice
as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on
different sides of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,
for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for
you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was
wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this
morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you
all!"

Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.

"She expects to be confined in February," continued Mrs. Jennings.

Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and
therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in
the paper.

"No, none at all," he replied, and read on.

"Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John. "Now, Palmer, you shall see a
monstrous pretty girl."

He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and
ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she
appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so
heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer
looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and
then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by
[95]the drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.



&quot;I declare they are quite charming.&quot;

[96]
"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,
mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at
them for ever." And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that
there were any such things in the room.

When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down
the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.

"My love, have you been asleep?" said his wife, laughing.

He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the
room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.
He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.

Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not choose to dine with them oftener
than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;
her daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to
see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of
pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,
likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not
likely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied&mdash;the carriage
should be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though
she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.
Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.

"Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.
"The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very
hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
either with them, or with us."

"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, "by
these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them
a few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are
grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere."




[97]
CHAPTER XX


As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next
day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as
good humoured and merry as before. She took them all most
affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them
again.

"I am so glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor
and Marianne, "for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any
thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet
again in town very soon, I hope."

They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.

"Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, "I shall be quite
disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for
you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I am
sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am
confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public."

They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.

"Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered
the room&mdash;"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to
town this winter."

Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies,
began complaining of the weather.

"How horrid all this is!" said he. "Such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as
without, by rain. It makes one detest all one's acquaintance. What the
devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?
How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the
weather."[98]

The rest of the company soon dropt in.

"I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, "you have not been able
to take your usual walk to Allenham today."

Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.

"Oh, don't be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer; "for we know all
about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think
he is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the
country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say."

"Much nearer thirty," said her husband.

"Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but
they say it is a sweet pretty place."

"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life," said Mr. Palmer.

Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed
her interest in what was said.

"Is it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer&mdash;"then it must be some other
place that is so pretty I suppose."

When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with
regret that they were only eight all together.

"My dear," said he to his lady, "it is very provoking that we should
be so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?"

"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,
that it could not be done? They dined with us last."

"You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings, "should not stand upon such
ceremony."

"Then you would be very ill-bred," cried Mr. Palmer.

"My love you contradict every body," said his wife with her usual
laugh. "Do you know that you are quite rude?"

"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother
ill-bred."

"Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said the good-natured old lady,
"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back
again. So there I have the whip hand of you."

Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid
of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,
as they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.
Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her
husband gave[99] her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was
highly diverted.

"Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. "He is
always out of humour."

Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him
credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred
as he wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly
woman,&mdash;but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of
distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment
of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was
the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too
common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by
establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to
attach any one to him except his wife.

"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, "I have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and
spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,&mdash;and come
while the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!
It will be quite delightful!&mdash;My love," applying to her husband,
"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"

"Certainly," he replied, with a sneer&mdash;"I came into Devonshire with no
other view."

"There now,"&mdash;said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you
cannot refuse to come."

They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.

"But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all
things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay
now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I
never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very
fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him."

Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the
hardship of such an obligation.[100]

"How charming it will be," said Charlotte, "when he is in
Parliament!&mdash;won't it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to
see all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know, he
says, he will never frank for me? He declares he won't. Don't you, Mr.
Palmer?"

Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.

"He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued; "he says it is
quite shocking."

"No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational. Don't palm all
your abuses of languages upon me."

"There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!
Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he
comes out with something so droll&mdash;all about any thing in the world."

She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,
by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.

"Certainly," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable."

"Well&mdash;I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant;
and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can
tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't
come to Cleveland. I can't imagine why you should object to it."

Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing
the subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable
that as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to
give some more particular account of Willoughby's general character,
than could be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with
him; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of
his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She
began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,
and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.

"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;&mdash;"Not
that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in
town. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while
he was at Allenham. Mama saw him here once before, but I was with my
uncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great
deal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very[101] unluckily
that we should never have been in the country together. He is very
little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do
not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you
know, and besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about
him, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of
it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."

"Upon my word," replied Elinor, "you know much more of the matter than
I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match."

"Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body
talks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town."

"My dear Mrs. Palmer!"

"Upon my honour I did. I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in
Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly."

"You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you
must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not
be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect
Colonel Brandon to do."

"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how
it happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and
so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and
another, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come
to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very
pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby
of Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you
have been in Devonshire so lately.'"

"And what did the Colonel say?"

"Oh&mdash;he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true,
so from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite
delightful, I declare! When is it to take place?"

"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?"

"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but
say fine things of you."

"I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I
think him uncommonly pleasing."[102]

"So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should
be so grave and so dull. Mamma says he was in love with your sister
too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly
ever falls in love with any body."

"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?" said
Elinor.

"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are
acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all
think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than
Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She
is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he
is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and
agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don't
think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think
you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,
though we could not get him to own it last night."

Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;
but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.

"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued Charlotte.
"And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can't think how
much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at
the cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your
sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at
Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts."

"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?"

"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular
friend of Sir John's. I believe," she added in a low voice, "he would
have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady
Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good
enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the
Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."

"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother
before it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?"[103]

"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have
liked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it
was before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr.
Palmer is the kind of man I like."




CHAPTER XXI


The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families
at Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not
last long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head,
had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a
cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at
the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and
wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause
of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and
observe.

In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young
ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be
her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them
directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter
were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such
an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on
the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a
visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose
elegance&mdash;whose tolerable gentility even&mdash;she could have no proof; for
the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
nothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the
worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore
unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about
their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent
their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with
all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with
merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or
six times every day.

[104]The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel
or unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very
civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the
furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that
Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they
had been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable
girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir
John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise,
and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of
the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the
sweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however,
there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest
girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under
every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir
John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at
his guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even
to keep a third cousin to himself.

"Do come now," said he&mdash;"pray come&mdash;you must come&mdash;I declare you shall
come&mdash;You can't think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous
pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all
hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they
both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that
you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told
them it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted
with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of
playthings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come?
Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. You are my
cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be related."

But Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of
their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in
amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their
attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of
the Miss Steeles to them.

When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place, they found in[105] the appearance of the
eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible
face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two
or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her
features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness
of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave
distinction to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and
Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw
with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves
agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual
raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring
their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the
importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in
admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be
doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in
which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing
delight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such
foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children,
the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous;
her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the
excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her
offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest
surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the
impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins
submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their
ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen
away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It
suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit
so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.

"John is in such spirits today!" said she, on his taking Miss Steele's
pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window&mdash;"He is full of
monkey tricks."

And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the
same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, "How playful William is!"
[106]


Mischievous tricks.


"And here is my sweet little Annamaria," she added, tenderly caressing
a little girl of three years old, who had not [107]made a noise for the
last two minutes; "And she is always so gentle and quiet&mdash;Never was
there such a quiet little thing!"

But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's
head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this
pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone
by any creature professedly noisy. The mother's consternation was
excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and
every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which
affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her
wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was
on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
the other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to
cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two
brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings
were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a
scene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been
successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of
screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that
it would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in
her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys
chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
had not known for many hours.

"Poor little creatures!" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.
"It might have been a very sad accident."

"Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless it had been under
totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of
heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in
reality."

"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.

Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not
feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the
whole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.
She did her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton
with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.

[108]"And Sir John too," cried the elder sister, "what a charming man he
is!"

Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,
came in without any &eacute;clat. She merely observed that he was perfectly
good humoured and friendly.

"And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine
children in my life. I declare I quite doat upon them already, and
indeed I am always distractedly fond of children."

"I should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile, "from what I have
witnessed this morning."

"I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the little Middletons rather
too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it
is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see
children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame
and quiet."

"I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I am at Barton Park, I never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence."

A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss
Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now
said rather abruptly, "And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex."

In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.

"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss
Steele.

"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemed
to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.

"I think every one must admire it," replied Elinor, "who ever saw
the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate
its beauties as we do."

"And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so
many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast
addition always."

"But why should you think," said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,
"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as
Sussex?"

"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there[109] an't. I'm
sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how
could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was
only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they
had not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may
not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with
them. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they
dress smart and behave civil. But I can't bear to see them dirty and
nasty. Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,
quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but
meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your
brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was
so rich?"

"Upon my word," replied Elinor, "I cannot tell you, for I do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that
if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him."

"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux&mdash;they have
something else to do."

"Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk of nothing but
beaux;&mdash;you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing
else." And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house
and the furniture.

This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not
blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want
of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish
of knowing them better.

Not so the Miss Steeles. They came from Exeter, well provided with
admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his
relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair
cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,
accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be
better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,
their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or
two together in the same room almost every[110] day. Sir John could do no
more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together
was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes
for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being
established friends.

To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their
unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew
or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate
particulars,&mdash;and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the
eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.

"'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure," said
she, "and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I
hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,&mdash;but perhaps you may
have a friend in the corner already."

Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in
proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been
with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of
the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since
Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to
her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks, as to excite general attention. The letter F had been likewise
invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless
jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with Elinor.

The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these
jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently
expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long
with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as
much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.

"His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper; "but pray
do not tell it, for it's a great secret."
[111]


Drinking to her best affections.


"Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?
What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss [112]Dashwood? a very agreeable
young man to be sure; I know him very well."

"How can you say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who generally made an
amendment to all her sister's assertions. "Though we have seen him
once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know
him very well."

Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. "And who was this
uncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?" She wished very
much to have the subject continued, though she did not choose to join
in it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time
in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity
after petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The
manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her
curiosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and
suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to
know something to his disadvantage. But her curiosity was unavailing,
for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele
when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.




CHAPTER XXII


Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from
the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her
behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her sentiments.

Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing;
and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her
agreeable; but her powers had received[113] no aid from education: she was
ignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,
her want of information in the most common particulars, could not be
concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to
appear to advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of
abilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she
saw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,
of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her
assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have
no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined
insincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their
meeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward
others made every show of attention and deference towards herself
perfectly valueless.

"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say," said Lucy to her
one day, as they were walking together from the park to the
cottage&mdash;"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?"

Elinor did think the question a very odd one, and her countenance
expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.

"Indeed!" replied Lucy; "I wonder at that, for I thought you must have
seen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she is?"

"No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's
mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity; "I know nothing of her."

"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such
a way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; "but
perhaps there may be reasons&mdash;I wish I might venture; but however I
hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
impertinent."

Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
saying, with some hesitation&mdash;

"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I
should not have the smallest fear of trusting you; indeed, I should
be very glad of your[114] advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable
situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble
you. I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars."

"I am sorry I do not," said Elinor, in great astonishment, "if it
could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her. But really I
never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
into her character."

"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But
if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs.
Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present&mdash;but the time may
come&mdash;how soon it will come must depend upon herself&mdash;when we may be
very intimately connected."

She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side
glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.

"Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean? Are you acquainted
with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?" And she did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.

"No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. Robert Ferrars&mdash;I never saw him in
my life; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor, "to his eldest brother."

What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and
though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt
in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.

"You may well be surprised," continued Lucy; "for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was
always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully
kept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it
but Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not
felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I
really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs.
Ferrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not
think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted
you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all
your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods
quite as his own sisters."&mdash;She paused.
[115]


Amiably bashful.

[116]
Elinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she
heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself
to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude&mdash;"May I ask
if your engagement is of long standing?"

"We have been engaged these four years."

"Four years!"

"Yes."

Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.

"I did not know," said she, "that you were even acquainted till the
other day."

"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my
uncle's care, you know, a considerable while."

"Your uncle!"

"Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?"

"I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
increased with her increase of emotion.

"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near
Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me
was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was
formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he
was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter
into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of
his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so
prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as
me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he
is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."

"Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after
a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's
honour and love, and her companion's falsehood&mdash;"Engaged to Mr. Edward
Ferrars!&mdash;I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
that really&mdash;I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake
of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."[117]

"We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling. "Mr. Edward Ferrars, the
eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your
sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must
allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on
who all my happiness depends."

"It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, "that I
should never have heard him even mention your name."

"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has
been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,
and, therefore, there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my
name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's
suspecting any thing, that was reason enough for his not mentioning
it."

She was silent. Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did not
sink with it.

"Four years you have been engaged," said she with a firm voice.

"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor
Edward! It puts him quite out of heart." Then taking a small miniature
from her pocket, she added, "To prevent the possibility of mistake, be
so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be
sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was
drew for. I have had it above these three years."

She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the
painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or
her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind,
she could have none of its being Edward's face. She returned it almost
instantly, acknowledging the likeness.

"I have never been able," continued Lucy, "to give him my picture in
return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so
anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity."

"You are quite in the right," replied Elinor calmly. They then
proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.

"I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in the world of your
faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what
importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother;[118] for she
would never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I
fancy she is an exceeding proud woman."

"I certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor; "but you do
me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your
secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety."

As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover
something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no
change.

"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,"
said she, "in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be
sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by
description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as
if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really
thought some explanation was due to you after my making such
particular inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate,
that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only
person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she
does me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of
her betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you
must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world
t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she
should out with it all. You can't think how much I go through in my
mind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I
have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years. Every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom&mdash;we can hardly
meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite
broke."

Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very
compassionate.

"Sometimes," continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, "I think whether
it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely."
As she said this, she looked directly at her companion. "But then at
other times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the
thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of
such a thing[119] would do. And on my own account too&mdash;so dear as he is to
me&mdash;I don't think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to
do in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?"

"Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the question; "but I can give
you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct
you."

"To be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both
sides, "his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor
Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful
low-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left
us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him
quite ill."

"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?"

"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he
came directly from town?"

"No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; "I remember he told us,
that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth."
She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning
nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect
even to their names.

"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy.

"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived."

"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was
the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more
than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor
fellow!&mdash;I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes
in wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;"
taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction
to Elinor. "You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but
that is not written so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he
had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible."

Elinor saw that it was his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This
picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been
accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a
correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few
moments, she was[120] almost overcome&mdash;her heart sunk within her, and she
could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that
her success was speedy, and for the time complete.

"Writing to each other," said Lucy, returning the letter into her
pocket, "is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I
have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even
that. If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave
him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last,
and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.
Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?"

"I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt
before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.

Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the
conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a
few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was
then at liberty to think and be wretched.




CHAPTER XXIII


However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,
it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the
present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to
be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt;
supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and
proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their
opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation
for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit
near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at
his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the
intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family
connections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,
the ring, formed[121] altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame
every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact,
which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. Her
resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,
for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas,
other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally
deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?
Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it
might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His
affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her
mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her
at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly
loved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much
could it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly
blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence
over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be
defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured
himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence
had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived
himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time
regain tranquillity; but he, what had he to look forward to? Could
he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his
affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his
delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like
her&mdash;illiterate, artful, and selfish?

The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to
every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding
years&mdash;years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the
understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,
while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.

If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his
difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were
they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was
undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune
to herself. These difficulties,[122] indeed, with a heart so alienated
from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy
was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family
opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!

As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she
wept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of
having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by
the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she
thought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow,
command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her
mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own
expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after
she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one
would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor
was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever
from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling
on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly
possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house.

The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had
been entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to
unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the
contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of
what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from
hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from
the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more
than she felt equal to support.

From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive
no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,
while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own
good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,
her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so
poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.

Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the
subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for
more reasons than one. She wanted to hear[123] many particulars of their
engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what
Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her
declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to
convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her
calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary
agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her
praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to
trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking
intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very
confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in
future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her
rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as
every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own
affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could
not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her
heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to
hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust
her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with
composure.

But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly
at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation. Such a thought would never enter[124] either Sir John or
Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever
given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.
They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together,
playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was
sufficiently noisy.

One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to
attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,
except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this
was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united
them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally
compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her
seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.

The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less
interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining
parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied
them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the
impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted
it only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then
placed, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever
entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They
all rose up in preparation for a round game.

"I am glad," said Lady Middleton to Lucy, "you are not going to finish
poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must
hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the
dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and
then I hope she will not much mind it."

This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and[125] replied,
"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have
been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am
resolved to finish the basket after supper."

"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes:&mdash;will you ring the
bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for
though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon
having it done."

Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with
an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could
taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt
child.

Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made
any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the
forms of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the
goodness to excuse me&mdash;you know I detest cards. I shall go to the
piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned." And without
farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.

Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never
made so rude a speech.

"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,"
said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; "and I do not
much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever
heard."

The remaining five were now to draw their cards.

"Perhaps," continued Elinor, "if I should happen to cut out, I may be
of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and
there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I
should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in
it."

"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help," cried
Lucy, "for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there
was; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria
after all."

"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed," said Miss Steele. "Dear little
soul, how I do love her!"

[126]"You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Elinor; "and as you
really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut
in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?"

Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by
a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
time. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at
which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might
safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.




CHAPTER XXIV


In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.

"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,
if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on
its subject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward
again."

"Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking the ice; you have set my
heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended
you by what I told you that Monday."

"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me," and Elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for
the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?"

"And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of
meaning, "there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
manner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was
angry with me; and have[127] been quarrelling with myself ever since, for
having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am
very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not
blame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of
my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am
sure."

"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,
to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall
never have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have
need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.
Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."

"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to
marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every
prospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very
small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love
him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all
that his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must
wait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the
world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and
constancy nothing can deprive me of I know."

"That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly
supported by the same trust in your's. If the strength of your
reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under
many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement,
your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."

Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her
countenance from every expression that could give her words a
suspicious tendency.

"Edward's love for me," said Lucy, "has been pretty well put to the
test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and
it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt
it now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm
on that account from the first."

Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.[128]

Lucy went on. "I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from
our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the
world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for
suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had
been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or
any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had
talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less
happy at Longstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am
particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case
I am sure I could not be deceived."

"All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty; but it can impose upon
neither of us."

"But what," said she after a short silence, "are your views? or have
you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a
melancholy and shocking extremity?&mdash;Is her son determined to submit to
this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in
which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure
for a while by owning the truth?"

"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs.
Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of
anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert,
and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my
inclination for hasty measures."

"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness
beyond reason."

Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.

"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.

"Not at all&mdash;I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his
brother&mdash;silly and a great coxcomb."

"A great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those
words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music. "Oh, they are talking of
their favourite beaux, I dare say."

"No sister," cried Lucy, "you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux
are not great coxcombs."

"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not," said Mrs. Jennings,
laughing heartily; "for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved
young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little
creature, there is no finding out who she likes."
[129]


&quot;I can answer for it,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings.

[130]

"Oh," cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, "I dare
say Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss
Dashwood's."

Elinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked
angrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy
first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was
then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto&mdash;

"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into
the secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen
enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every
other profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as
he can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be
kind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some
regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland
living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present
incumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for
us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest."

"I should always be happy," replied Elinor, "to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my
interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is
brother to Mrs. John Dashwood&mdash;that must be recommendation enough to
her husband."

"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into
orders."

"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little."

They were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with
a deep sigh&mdash;

"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
once by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties
on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we
should be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your
advice, Miss Dashwood?"

"No," answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated
feelings, "on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the
side of your wishes."

[131]"Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great solemnity; "I know
nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do
really believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all
means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be
more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it
immediately."

Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and
replied, "This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving
any opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence
much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached
is too much for an indifferent person."

"'Tis because you are an indifferent person," said Lucy, with some
pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, "that your
judgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be
supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your
opinion would not be worth having."

Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve;
and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.
Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this
speech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.

"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?" said she with all
her accustomary complacency.

"Certainly not."

"I am sorry for that," returned the other, while her eyes brightened
at the information, "it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
there! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your
brother and sister will ask you to come to them."

"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do."

"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who
have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go
for the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise
London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it."

Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion[132] of the
first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was
therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any
reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them
dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down
to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not
only without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that
he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which
sincere affection on her side would have given, for self-interest
alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which
she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.

From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when
entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing
it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her
happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated
by the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as
civility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an
indulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to
herself.

The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond
what the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could
not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of
their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of
the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which
was in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to
stay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due
celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share
of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.




CHAPTER XXV


Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not
without a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her
husband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the
town, she had resided every winter in[133] a house in one of the streets
near Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of
January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and
very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to
accompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her
sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan,
immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she
believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason
alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at
that time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some
surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.

"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I do
beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart
upon it. Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I
shan't put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be
sending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford that. We three
shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,
if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always
go with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to
it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my
hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of
you; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have
done with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for
you to all the young men, you may depend upon it."

"I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne would not object
to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very
hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss
Dashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for
town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss
Dashwood about it."

"Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of
Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only
the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable
for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might
talk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one
or the other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord[134] bless me! how do
you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used
till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let
us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her
mind by and bye, why so much the better."

"I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you," said Marianne, with warmth:
"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,&mdash;I
feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made
less happy, less comfortable by our absence&mdash;Oh! no, nothing should
tempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle."

Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and
saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by
her eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother's
decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any
support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not
approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had
particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her
mother would be eager to promote&mdash;she could not expect to influence
the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which
she had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared
not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.
That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,
was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared
to witness.

On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that
such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her
daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to
herself, how much the[135] heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of
their declining the offer upon her account; insisted on their both
accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual
cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,
from this separation.

"I am delighted with the plan," she cried, "it is exactly what I could
wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.
When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret
so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you should go to
town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be
under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to
you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your
brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,
when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly
estranged from each other."

"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness," said Elinor, "you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
cannot be so easily removed."

Marianne's countenance sunk.

"And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent Elinor going to
suggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do let
me hear a word about the expense of it."

"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's
heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or
whose protection will give us consequence."

"That is very true," replied her mother, "but of her society,
separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing
at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady
Middleton."

"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings," said
Marianne, "at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation.
I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."[136]

Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in
persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved
within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go
likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her
domestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily
reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,
was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without
any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.

"I will have you both go," said Mrs. Dashwood; "these objections are
nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of
sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her
acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family."

Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her
mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on
this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to
begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, "I like Edward
Ferrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the
rest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me,
whether I am ever known to them or not."

Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in
astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held
her tongue.

After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness
and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was
delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in
London, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being
delighted, which was putting herself rather out of[137] her way; and as
for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them.

Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with
less reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and
when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her
sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she
could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence.

Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her
unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.
Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one
of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short
of eternal.

Their departure took place in the first week in January. The
Middletons were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their
station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the
family.




CHAPTER XXVI


Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,
without wondering at her own situation, so short had their
acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age
and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a
measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with
that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally
shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every
occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the
rapture of delightful expectation which filled[138] the whole soul and
beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own
prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and
how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation
to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of
hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what
Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in
town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on
finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every
new light as to his character which her own observation or the
intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his
behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain
what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.
Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was
determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be
otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature&mdash;she must then
learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which
might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.

They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as
they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in
silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque
beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight
exclusively addressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct
therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility
which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to
Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her
whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both
with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their
ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them
choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their
preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They
reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released,
after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to
enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.

The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and[139] the young
ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable
apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece
still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof
of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some
effect.

As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her
mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did
the same. "I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor; "had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?"

"I am not going to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily,
and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more;
it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;
and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her
pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.
Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be
no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the
direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter
conveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at
once.

Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any
dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.

It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being
much engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.
The tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been
disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a
loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any
other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's
approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every
thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she[140] opened
the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening
half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a
conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy
of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, "Oh,
Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and seemed almost ready to
throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.

It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she
immediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the
same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her;
and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister
should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and
disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not
unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the
room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the
recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.

"Is your sister ill?" said he.

Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of
head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to
which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.

He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect
himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of
his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries
about their journey, and the friends they had left behind.

In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether
Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by
any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying
something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen
him last. "Yes," he replied, with some embarrassment, "almost ever
since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it
has never been in my power to return to Barton."

This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to
her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and
she was fearful that her[141] question had implied much more curiosity on
the subject than she had ever felt.

Mrs. Jennings soon came in. "Oh! Colonel," said she, with her usual
noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad to see you&mdash;sorry I could not
come before&mdash;beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me
a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have
been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things
to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had
Cartwright to settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever
since dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I
should be in town today?"

"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been
dining."

"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does
Charlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time."

"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,
that you will certainly see her to-morrow."

"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two
young ladies with me, you see&mdash;that is, you see but one of them now,
but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too&mdash;which
you will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr.
Willoughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be
young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very
handsome&mdash;worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I
don't know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has
been dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you
been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come,
let's have no secrets among friends."

He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but
without satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and
Marianne was obliged to appear again.

After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to
stay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.[142]

Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished
their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and
in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see
them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure
from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at
their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all
along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after
having declined her own, though at the same time she would never have
forgiven them if they had not come!

"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you," said she; "What do you think
he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma? I forget what it was
now, but it was something so droll!"

After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,
or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on
Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to
which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it
at first was induced to go likewise.

Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond
Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in
constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her
mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them,
from all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and
dissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of
any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both:
she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at
home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the
tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing
pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on
none, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.

It was late in the morning before they returned home; and[143] no sooner
had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and
when Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a
sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been
there.

"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she to
the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the
negative. "Are you quite sure of it?" she replied. "Are you certain
that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"

The man replied that none had.

"How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she
turned away to the window.

"How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her
sister with uneasiness. "If she had not known him to be in town she
would not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to
Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come
nor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an
engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be
carried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire;
and how will my interference be borne."

She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances
continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would
represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some
serious enquiry into the affair.

Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate
acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with
them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening
engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she
would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her
own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure
to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of
expectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured
for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she
returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and
forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to
the window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.




[144]
CHAPTER XXVII


"If this open weather holds much longer," said Mrs. Jennings, when
they met at breakfast the following morning, "Sir John will not like
leaving Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a
day's pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem
to take it so much to heart."

"That is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to
the window as she spoke, to examine the day. "I had not thought of
that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."

It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.
"It is charming weather for them indeed," she continued, as she sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. "How much they
must enjoy it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot be
expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a
series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts
will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day
or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer&mdash;nay,
perhaps it may freeze tonight!"

"At any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, "I dare say we
shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next
week."

"Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way."

"And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she will write to Combe by
this day's post."

But if she did, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the
truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could
not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy
in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation
of a frost.

The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the[145] houses of Mrs.
Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and
Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air.

"Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem
parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a
clear afternoon."

Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning
in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of
approaching frost.

The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her
behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret,
she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction
could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased
to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she
had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much
real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at
home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.

Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from
any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
concern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a
strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which
he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than
when at Barton.

About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby
was also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the
morning's drive.

"Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been here while we were out."
Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in[146] London, now ventured
to say, "Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow." But Marianne
seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped
with the precious card.

This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this
moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every
hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on being
left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.

Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley
Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when
they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no
second visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the
table.

"For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.

"No, ma'am, for my mistress."

But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.

"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!"

"You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor, unable to be longer
silent.

"Yes, a little&mdash;not much."

After a short pause. "You have no confidence in me, Marianne."

"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from you&mdash;you who have confidence in no
one!"

"Me!" returned Elinor in some confusion; "indeed, Marianne, I have
nothing to tell."

"Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our situations then are
alike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do
not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."

Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was
not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
press for greater openness in Marianne.

Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it
aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and
cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and a
violent[147] cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew
near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some
difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen
nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for
amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again
in her absence.

Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty
young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,
however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.

Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to
avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and
therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on
their entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know
who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side
of the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she
entered: it was enough&mdash;he was not there&mdash;and she sat down, equally
ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been
assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss
Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though
Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house,
and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were
to come.

"I thought you were both in Devonshire," said he.

"Did you?" replied Elinor.

"When do you go back again?"

"I do not know." And thus ended their discourse.

Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was
that evening, and never so much fatigued by[148] the exercise. She
complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.

"Aye, aye," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the reason of all that very
well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you
would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."

"Invited!" cried Marianne.

"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him
somewhere in the street this morning." Marianne said no more, but
looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears
for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure
by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other
person.

About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too
restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all
that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging
her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an
account of her real situation with respect to him.

Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the
window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he
entered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in
particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.
Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her
sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the
first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than
once before, beginning with the observation of "your sister looks
unwell to-day," or "your[149] sister seems out of spirits," he had
appeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,
something particular about her. After a pause of several minutes,
their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some
agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a
brother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no
answer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of
asking what he meant? He tried to smile as he replied, "your sister's
engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known."

"It cannot be generally known," returned Elinor, "for her own family
do not know it."

He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, I am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy
intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally
talked of."

"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?"

"By many&mdash;by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you
are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But
still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to
support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,
accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in
your sister's writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I
could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it
impossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in
saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I
have the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if
concealment be possible, is all that remains."

These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for
her sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to
say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated
for a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The
real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little
known to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as[150]
liable to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that
Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel
Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and
at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she
thought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say
more than she really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore,
that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on
which they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no
doubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.

He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,
rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,
"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve her,"&mdash;took leave, and went away.

Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on
the contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's
unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.




CHAPTER XXVIII


Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby
neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time
to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this
party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and
seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared,
without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the
drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's
arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her
attitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's
presence; and when at last they were told that[151] Lady Middleton waited
for them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one
was expected.

They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended
the stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to
another in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,
quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their
tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were
permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some
time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and
Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
distance from the table.

They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon
caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to
speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see
her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor
turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be
unobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her
whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved
towards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.

"Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is there&mdash;he is there&mdash;Oh! why does
he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?"

"Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and do not betray what you
feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet."

This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne,
it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which
affected every feature.
[152]


At that moment she first perceived him.


At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,
and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to
him. He approached, and addressing [153]himself rather to Elinor than
Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to
observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs.
Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed
of all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a
word. But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her
face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest
emotion, "Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you
not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?"

He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and
he held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was
evidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and
saw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment's pause, he
spoke with calmness.

"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,
and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope."

"But have you not received my notes?" cried Marianne in the wildest
anxiety. "Here is some mistake I am sure&mdash;some dreadful mistake. What
can be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell
me, what is the matter?"

He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment
returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom
he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant
exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had
the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town,
which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away with a
slight bow and joined his friend.

Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried
to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with
lavender water.

"Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as she could speak, "and force
him to come to me. Tell him I must see him again&mdash;must speak to him
instantly. I cannot rest&mdash;I shall not have a moment's peace till this
is explained&mdash;some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him
this moment."[154]

"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is
not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow."

With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him
herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at
least, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him
with more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne
continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her
feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw
Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and
telling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking
to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She
instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them
home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer.

Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed
that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her
wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they
departed as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a
silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings
was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,
where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon
undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her
sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs.
Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.

That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and
Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,
seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own
wishes, she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of
sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still
stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which
seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that
would bear investigation. Absence[155] might have weakened his regard, and
convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a
regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.

As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her
in its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest
concern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she
could esteem Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided
in future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance
that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby&mdash;in an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him.




CHAPTER XXIX


Before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun
gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne,
only half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for
the sake of all the little light she could command from it, and
writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this
situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first
perceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent
anxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness&mdash;

"Marianne, may I ask&mdash;"

"No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing; you will soon know all."

The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no
longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return
of the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could
go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still
obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of
her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the
last time to Willoughby.

Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power;
and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her[156] still more, had
not Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such
circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long
together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her
wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of
every body.

At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and
Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in
pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to
engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.

As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a
considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,
round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to
Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a
death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as
plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come
from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her
hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremor as
made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That
good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from
Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she
treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it
to her liking. Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and
calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she
said&mdash;

"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
life! My girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish
enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I
hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her waiting much
longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.
Pray, when are they to be married?"

Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this,[157] and, therefore,
trying to smile, replied, "And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I
thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to
imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive
yourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married."

"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don't we
all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in
love with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see
them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
clothes? Come, come, this won't do. Because you are so sly about it
yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such
thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever
so long. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte."

"Indeed, Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously, "you are mistaken.
Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now."

Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,
and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried
away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne
stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,
and two or three others laying by her. Elinor drew near, but without
saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed
her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of
tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The
latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction,
she put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her
face with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who
knew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its
course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat
spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as
follows:[158]&mdash;

"Bond Street, January.

"My Dear Madam,

"I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for
which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much
concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last
night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am
quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so
unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of
what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional.
I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your
family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and
flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or
misapprehension of my actions. My esteem for your whole
family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as
to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to
express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more
guarded in my professions of that esteem. That I should ever
have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you
understand that my affections have been long engaged
elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I
obey your commands in returning the letters with which I
have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you
so obligingly bestowed on me.

I am, dear Madam,

Your most obedient humble servant,

"John Willoughby."

With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss
Dashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it
must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their
separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be
suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby
capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable
and delicate feeling&mdash;so far from the common decorum of a gentleman,
as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of
bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret,
acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection
whatever;&mdash;a letter of which every line was an insult, and which
proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.

She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then
read it again and again; but every perusal only[159] served to increase
her abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against
him, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound
Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss
to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most
irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an
unprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most
important.

In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the
depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the
very different mind of a very different person, who had no other
connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with
every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her
sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and
so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on
hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see
who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to
perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered
till one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of
contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse
herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being
indisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for
its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing
her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise
from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from
falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest
and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many
nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no
longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this
was felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous
faintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,
made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some
sense of her kindness, by saying, "Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make
you!"

"I only wish," replied her sister, "there were any thing I could do,
which might be of comfort to you."

This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,
who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her[160] heart, "Oh! Elinor, I
am miserable, indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.

Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in
silence.

"Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried, "if you would not kill
yourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her
misery while you suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself."

"I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave me, leave me, if I
distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.
Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of
exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, you cannot have an idea of what I
suffer."

"Do you call me happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew!&mdash;And can you
believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"

"Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms round her sister's neck;
"I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you
are&mdash;you must be happy; Edward loves you&mdash;what, oh what, can do away
such happiness as that?"

"Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.

"No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves you, and only you. You
can have no grief."

"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state."

"And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing
can do away."

"You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is
your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you
suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of
his character had been delayed to a later period;&mdash;if your engagement
had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,
before he chose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy
confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful."

"Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been no engagement."

"No engagement!"

"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith
with me."[161]

"But he told you that he loved you."

"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never
professedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been&mdash;but it never
was."

"Yet you wrote to him?"&mdash;

"Yes&mdash;could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot
talk."

Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now
raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the
contents of all. The first, which was what her sister had sent him on
their arrival in town, was to this effect:&mdash;

"Berkeley Street, January.

"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this;
and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when
you know that I am in town. An opportunity of coming hither,
though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not
resist. I wish you may receive this in time to come here
tonight, but I will not depend on it. At any rate I shall
expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.

M.D."

Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance
at the Middletons', was in these words:&mdash;

"I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the
day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having
received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week
ago. I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more
to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call again as soon
as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected
this in vain. You had better come earlier another time,
because we are generally out by one. We were last night at
Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance. I have been told
that you were asked to be of the party. But could it be so?
You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if
that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not
suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your
personal assurance of its being otherwise.

M.D."

The contents of her last note to him were these:[162]&mdash;

"What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last
night? Again I demand an explanation of it. I was prepared
to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally
produced, with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton
appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have
passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct
which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though
I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for
your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your
justification of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or
purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may
have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what it is, explain
the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in
being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be
obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am
to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed
you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your
behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told
as soon as possible. My feelings are at present in a state
of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty
on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your
sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my
notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.

M.D."

That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have
been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been
unwilling to believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to
the impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was
silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such
unsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,
and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving
that she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained
nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation.

"I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if
the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other."

"I can believe it," said Elinor; "but unfortunately he did not feel
the same."

"He did feel the same, Elinor&mdash;for weeks and weeks he[163] felt it. I
know he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the
blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear
to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can
so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his
voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being
together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me
that it might be many weeks before we met again&mdash;his distress&mdash;can I
ever forget his distress?"

For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had
passed away, she added, in a firmer tone&mdash;

"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby."

"Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been
instigated?"

"By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather
believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me
in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This
woman of whom he writes&mdash;whoever she be&mdash;or any one, in short, but
your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to
bely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I
would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know
so well?"

Elinor would not contend, and only replied, "Whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,
my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence."

"No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine has no pride. I care
not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be
open to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be
proud and independent as they like&mdash;may resist insult, or return
mortification&mdash;but I cannot. I must feel&mdash;I must be wretched&mdash;and they
are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can."

"But for my mother's sake and mine&mdash;"

"I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so
miserable&mdash;Oh! who can require it?"

Again they were both silent. Elinor was employed in[164] walking
thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,
without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning
objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the
bed, with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up
Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,
exclaimed&mdash;

"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!
Cruel, cruel&mdash;nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he
might have heard against me, ought he not to have suspended his
belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power
of clearing myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)
which you so obligingly bestowed on me'&mdash;That is unpardonable.
Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,
barbarously insolent!&mdash;Elinor, can he be justified?"

"No, Marianne, in no possible way."

"And yet this woman&mdash;who knows what her art may have been?&mdash;how long
it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!&mdash;Who
is she?&mdash;Who can she be?&mdash;Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young
and attractive among his female acquaintance?&mdash;Oh! no one, no one&mdash;he
talked to me only of myself."

Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended
thus:&mdash;

"Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be
gone to-morrow?"

"To-morrow, Marianne!"

"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake&mdash;and
now who cares for me? Who regards me?"

"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much
more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent
such a hasty removal as that."

"Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long,
I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.
The Middletons and Palmers&mdash;how am I to bear their pity? The pity of
such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would he say to that!"

Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but
no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body
she moved from one posture[165] to another, till growing more and more
hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at
all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length
persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings
returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.




CHAPTER XXX


Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and
without waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the
door and walked in with a look of real concern.

"How do you do my dear?"&mdash;said she in a voice of great compassion to
Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.

"How is she, Miss Dashwood?&mdash;Poor thing! she looks very bad. No
wonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon&mdash;a
good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told
me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend
of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;
and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say
is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance
abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his
heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I
have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet him
again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a
day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the
only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face
you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her
any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done
with. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know,
and that will amuse her."

She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she
supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.

[166]Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with
them. Elinor even advised her against it. But "no, she would go down;
she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less."
Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,
though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,
said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,
while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.

When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was
calmer than her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had
she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged
attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but
not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts
preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.

Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its
effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous,
made her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities,
which her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good
friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was
due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her
therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a
favourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have
the best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy
in the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the
day. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a
check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's
endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of
sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. As soon, however, as the
consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on
Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of
Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got
up and hurried out of the room.

"Poor soul!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, "how it
grieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without
finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to
do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I
would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to
me, that a man[167] should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there
is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord
bless you! they care no more about such things!"

"The lady then&mdash;Miss Grey I think you called her,&mdash;is very rich?"

"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart,
stylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very
well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family
are all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it
won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No
wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don't
signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes
love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to
fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is
ready to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let
his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?
I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till
matters came round. But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way
of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age."

"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be
amiable?"

"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her
mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day
Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison
would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison
could never agree."&mdash;

"And who are the Ellisons?"

"Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for
herself; and a pretty choice she has made!&mdash;What now," after pausing a
moment&mdash;"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan
by herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it
seems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a
few friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?
She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?"

"Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,
will not leave her room again this evening. I[168] shall persuade her if I
can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."

"Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own
supper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and
so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been
hanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came
today finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I
would not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know,
how should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but
a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at
about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when
they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in
Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see
them tomorrow."

"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and
Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature
must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to
myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my
dear madam will easily believe."

"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear
it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a
word about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.
No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I
certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such
things, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot. And what
does talking ever do you know?"

"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many
cases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances
which, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to
become the public conversation. I must do this justice to Mr.
Willoughby&mdash;he has broken no positive engagement with my sister."

"Law, my dear! Don't pretend to defend him. No positive engagement
indeed! after taking her all over Allenham[169] House, and fixing on the
very rooms they were to live in hereafter!"

Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press the subject farther,
and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since,
though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the
enforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides,
Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.

"Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be
all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye,
that he will. Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer. Lord!
how he'll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will
be all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year
without debt or drawback&mdash;except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I
had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and
then what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;
exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and
conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in
one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were
there! Then, there is a dovecote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a
very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;
and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the
carriages that pass along. Oh! 'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in
the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my
fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are
forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour
nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon
as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we
can but put Willoughby out of her head!"

"Ay, if we can do that, Ma'am," said Elinor, "we shall do very well
with or without Colonel Brandon." And then rising, she went away to
join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,
leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.[170]

"You had better leave me," was all the notice that her sister received
from her.

"I will leave you," said Elinor, "if you will go to bed." But this,
from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first
refused to do. Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,
however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her
aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some
quiet rest before she left her.

In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by
Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.

"My dear," said she, entering, "I have just recollected that I have
some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was
tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor
husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old
colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the
world. Do take it to your sister."

"Dear Ma'am," replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended, "how good you are! But I have
just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think
nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me
leave, I will drink the wine myself."

Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes
earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she
swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its
healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried
on herself as on her sister.

Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner
of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied
that he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short,
that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs.
Jennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his
entrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor
presided, and whispered, "The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.
He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."
[171]


&quot;How fond he was of it!&quot;


He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's, and, with [172]a look
which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after
her sister.

"Marianne is not well," said she. "She has been indisposed all day,
and we have persuaded her to go to bed."

"Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morning
may be&mdash;there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at
first."

"What did you hear?"

"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think&mdash;in short, that a man,
whom I knew to be engaged&mdash;but how shall I tell you? If you know it
already, as surely you must, I may be spared."

"You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness, "Mr. Willoughby's
marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we do know it all. This seems to have
been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first
unfolded it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear
it?"

"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies
were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other
an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting
concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name
of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my
attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing
was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey&mdash;it was
no longer to be a secret&mdash;it would take place even within a few weeks,
with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,
especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still
more:&mdash;as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe
Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!&mdash;but it would be
impossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt,
on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.
Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss
Grey's guardian."

"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand
pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation."

"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable&mdash;at least I think&mdash;" he
stopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust
itself, "And your sister, how did she,&mdash;"[173]

"Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they
may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel
affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;
and even now, perhaps&mdash;but I am almost convinced that he never was
really attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some
points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."

"Ah!" said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed! But your sister does
not&mdash;I think you said so&mdash;she does not consider quite as you do?"

"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still
justify him if she could."

He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the
tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was
necessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss
Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel
Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of
hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening
more serious and thoughtful than usual.




CHAPTER XXXI


From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had
closed her eyes.

Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt;
and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject
again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate
counsel on Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying
opinions on Marianne's, as before. Sometimes she could believe
Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at
others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.
At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all
the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and
at a third could resist it with energy. In one thing, however,[174] she
was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was
possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence
when obliged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief
of Mrs. Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion.

"No, no, no, it cannot be," she cried; "she cannot feel. Her kindness
is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants
is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it."

Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her
sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable
refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a
polished manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half
there be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities
and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She
expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own,
and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their
actions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters
were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart
of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her
own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,
though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost
good-will.

With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,
from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room,
saying&mdash;

"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good."

Marianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her
a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,
explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and
instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the
room to enforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the
assurances of his letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the
next. The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was
before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed
such an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant,
she had never suffered.

The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach[175] in her
moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could
reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
passionate violence&mdash;a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still
referring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was
calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled
every page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and
relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by
Elinor's application, to entreat from Marianne greater openness
towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such
affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future
happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of
it.

All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was
dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her
mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be
gone. Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for
Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own
except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at
length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.

Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy
till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as
herself; and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out
alone for the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart,
aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by
Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation
for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had
passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who
came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained
fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her
pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving
still more fondly over its effect on her mother.

In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when
Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was
startled by a rap at the door.

"Who can this be?" cried Elinor. "So early too! I thought we had
been safe."

[176]Marianne moved to the window&mdash;

"It is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation. "We are never safe
from him."

"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home."

"I will not trust to that," retreating to her own room. "A man who
has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion
on that of others."

The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on
injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon did come in; and Elinor,
who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither,
and who saw that solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,
and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive
her sister for esteeming him so lightly.

"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said he, after the first
salutation, "and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more
easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you
alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object&mdash;my wish&mdash;my sole
wish in desiring it&mdash;I hope, I believe it is&mdash;is to be a means of
giving comfort;&mdash;no, I must not say comfort&mdash;not present comfort&mdash;but
conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind. My regard for
her, for yourself, for your mother&mdash;will you allow me to prove it, by
relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere
regard&mdash;nothing but an earnest desire of being useful&mdash;I think I am
justified&mdash;though where so many hours have been spent in convincing
myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be
wrong?" He stopped.

"I understand you," said Elinor. "You have something to tell me of Mr.
Willoughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. My
gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end, and hers must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me
hear it."

"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,&mdash;but
this will give you no idea&mdash;I must go farther back. You will find me a
very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A
short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it shall
be a short one. On such a subject," sighing heavily, "can I have
little temptation to be diffuse."

[177]He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went
on.

"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation&mdash;(it is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on you)&mdash;a conversation
between us one evening at Barton Park&mdash;it was the evening of a
dance&mdash;in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling,
in some measure, your sister Marianne."

"Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have not forgotten it." He looked
pleased by this remembrance, and added&mdash;

"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an
orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our
ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not
love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as
perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you
might think me incapable of having ever felt. Her's, for me, was, I
believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby
and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At
seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married&mdash;married
against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our
family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be
said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.
My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped
that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for
some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she
experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though
she had promised me that nothing&mdash;but how blindly I relate! I have
never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of
eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my
cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation
far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,
till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too
far, and the blow was a severe one, but had her marriage been happy,
so young as I[178] then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it,
or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not
the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not
what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her
unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so
inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it
been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a
husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or
restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their
marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should
fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps&mdash;but I meant to promote the
happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose
had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me,"
he continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of trifling
weight&mdash;was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years
afterwards, of her divorce. It was that which threw this
gloom,&mdash;even now the recollection of what I suffered&mdash;"

He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes
about the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by
his distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her,
took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.

"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned
to England. My first care, when I did arrive, was of course to seek
for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could
not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to
fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of
sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor
sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,
that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to
dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I
had been six months in England, I did find her. Regard for a former
servant[179] of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me
to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and
there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my
unfortunate sister. So altered&mdash;so faded&mdash;worn down by acute suffering
of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure
before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,
on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her&mdash;but I
have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it&mdash;I
have pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in
the last stage of a consumption, was&mdash;yes, in such a situation it was
my greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time
for a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her
placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited
her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her
last moments."

Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in
an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate
friend.

"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he, "by the
resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.
Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural
sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a
happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see
the other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been
distressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood&mdash;a subject such as
this&mdash;untouched for fourteen years&mdash;it is dangerous to handle it at
all! I will be more collected&mdash;more concise. She left to my care her
only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty
connection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child,
and had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to
me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by
watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations
allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was
therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and
after the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago,
and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she
visited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I[180] am
well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer
connection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached
her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her
under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,
who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time
of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her
situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly
disappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned
out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young
friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him
to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his
daughter&mdash;better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and
ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though
she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a
quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for
he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were
ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he
tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of
his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I
could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight
long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I feared,
may be imagined; and what I suffered too."

"Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "could it be&mdash;could Willoughby!"&mdash;

"The first news that reached me of her," he continued, "came in a
letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from
Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party
to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,
which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,
and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby
imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one
whom he had made poor and miserable; but had he known it, what would
it have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the
smiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who
can feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and
innocence he had seduced, in[181] a situation of the utmost distress, with
no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He
had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor
relieved her."

"This is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.

"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse
than both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess
what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever,
and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have
felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you
alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to
do when it was known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you
then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so
deceived; to see your sister&mdash;but what could I do? I had no hope of
interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's
influence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable
usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may
have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless will, turn
with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with
that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless
situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an
affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a
mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.
Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her
own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can
bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still
more her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for
her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own
discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You
must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and
from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her
regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this
account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to
have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others."

Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;
attended too with the assurance of her expecting[182] material advantage
to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.

"I have been more pained," said she, "by her endeavors to acquit him
than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first
she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have
you," she continued, after a short silence, "ever seen Mr. Willoughby
since you left him at Barton?"

"Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have. One meeting was unavoidable."

Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying&mdash;

"What? have you met him to&mdash;"

"I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most
reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town,
which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he
to defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the
meeting, therefore, never got abroad."

Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a
soldier she presumed not to censure it.

"Such," said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, "has been the unhappy
resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so
imperfectly have I discharged my trust!"

"Is she still in town?"

"No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near
her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there
she remains."

Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor
from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again
the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion
and esteem for him.




[183]
CHAPTER XXXII


When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne
appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to
it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
seemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But
though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
was carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the
effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he
called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind
of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less
violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.
Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.
She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she
had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss
Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his
designs might once have been on herself, preyed altogether so much
on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she
felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave
more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most
open and most frequent confession of them.

To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly
less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than
Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her
anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of
Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which
she could wish her not to indulge![184]

Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had
determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at
that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by
constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen
him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all
means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of
which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to
comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of
objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would
be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at
times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some
amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.

From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her
friends. Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of
Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at
Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at
first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain
one.

She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where
they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his
wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother.

Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she
submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved
perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt
it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by
requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only
possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her
mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her ever knowing a moment's rest.

But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what[185] brought
evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the
other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid
Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their
longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it
would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.

Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's
name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing
it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all.

Sir John, could not have thought it possible. "A man of whom he had
always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He
did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an
unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.
He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for
all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,
and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel
of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met
that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end
of it!"

Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. "She was determined to
drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she
had never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her
heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,
for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much
that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should
tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was."

The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shown in procuring all the
particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and
communicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker's
the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's
portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be
seen.
[186]


Offered him one of Folly&#39;s puppies.


The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as [187]they often were by
the clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to
be sure of exciting no interest in one person at least among their
circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was one who
would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any
anxiety for her sister's health.

Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the
moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried
down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more
indispensable to comfort than good-nature.

Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,
or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, "It is very
shocking, indeed!" and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the
dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was
wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though
rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would
at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her
as soon as she married.

Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
confidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her
voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or
could oblige herself to speak to him. These assured him that his
exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and
these gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;
but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that
the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither
prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make
it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
Mid-summer, they would not be[188] married till Michaelmas, and by the end
of a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding
between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that
the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would
all be made over to her; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased
to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.

Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's
letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he
was married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she
was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it
from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every
morning.

She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on
it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would
burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.

The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now
hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to
prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.

About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's
house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn, presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.

Elinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her
pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her still in town.

"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here
still," said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.
"But I always thought I should I was almost sure you would not leave
London yet awhile; though you told me, you know, at Barton, that you
should not stay above a month. But I thought, at the time, that you
would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your[189] brother and
sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.
I am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word."

Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her
self-command to make it appear that she did not.

"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did you travel?"

"Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss Steele, with quick
exultation; "we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to
attend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join
him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did."

"Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is
a single man, I warrant you."

"There now," said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, "everybody laughs
at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they
are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never
think about him from one hour's end to another. 'Lord! here comes your
beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing
the street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I&mdash;I cannot think who
you mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine."

"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking&mdash;but it won't do&mdash;the Doctor is
the man, I see."

"No, indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, "and I
beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."

Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she
certainly would not, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.

"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss
Dashwood, when they come to town," said Lucy, returning, after a
cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.

"No, I do not think we shall."

"Oh, yes, I dare say you will."

Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.

"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together!"

"Long a time, indeed!" interposed Mrs. Jennings. "Why, their visit is
but just begun!"
[190]


A very smart beau.


[191]

Lucy was silenced.

"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss
Steele. "I am sorry she is not well&mdash;" for Marianne had left the room
on their arrival.

"You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with
nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation."

"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and
me!&mdash;I think she might see us; and I am sure we would not speak a
word."

Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore
not able to come to them.

"Oh, if that's all," cried Miss Steele, "we can just as well go and
see her."

Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but
she was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand,
which now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness
to the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of
the other.




CHAPTER XXXIII


After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties,
and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for
half an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no
visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in
Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the
exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.

When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there
was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call;
and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her
young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return
for them.

On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people
before them in the room, that there was not a[192] person at liberty to
tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be
done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to
promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing
there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting
his politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye,
and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He
was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size,
shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining
and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the
shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no
leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was
comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which
served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of
strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first
style of fashion.

Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on
the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by
remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect
her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing
around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.

At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,
all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the
last day on which his existence could be continued without the
possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely
care, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a
one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off
with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.

Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point
of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her
side. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some
surprise to be her brother.
[193]


Introduced to Mrs. Jennings.


Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop. John Dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his sisters again; [194]it rather gave them
satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive.

Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.

"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday," said he, "but it was
impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts
at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs.
Ferrars. Harry was vastly pleased. This morning I had fully intended
to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one
has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to
bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able
to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs.
Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the
Middletons too, you must introduce me to them. As my mother-in-law's
relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are
excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand."

"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness
in every particular, is more than I can express."

"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.
But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are
related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the
most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it, I assure you."

Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.
Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for
them at the door.

Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs.
Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being
able to call on them the next day, took leave.
[195]

<img src="images/image_219.jpg" width="500" height="720" alt="Mrs. Jennings assured him directly that she should not
stand upon ceremony."  />
Mrs. Jennings assured him directly that she should not
stand upon ceremony.


His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from
their sister-in-law, for not coming too; "but she was so much engaged
with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where."
Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not
stand upon ceremony, for they were [196]all cousins, or something like
it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and
bring her sisters to see her. His manners to them, though calm, were
perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on
Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a
curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be
rich, to be equally civil to him.

After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him
to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as
they were out of the house, his enquiries began.

"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?"

"Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire."

"I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,
Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life."

"Me, brother! what do you mean?"

"He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What
is the amount of his fortune?"

"I believe about two thousand a year."

"Two thousand a-year;" and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity, he added, "Elinor, I wish with all my heart
it were twice as much, for your sake."

"Indeed I believe you," replied Elinor; "but I am very sure that
Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me.

"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little
trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be
undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his
friends may all advise him against it. But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should
not try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your side&mdash;in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is
quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable&mdash;you have
too much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man;
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with
you and your family. It is a match that must give universal
satisfaction. In[197] short, it is a kind of thing that," lowering his
voice to an important whisper, "will be exceedingly welcome to all
parties." Recollecting himself, however, he added, "That is, I mean
to say&mdash;your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled;
Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I
assure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured
woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much
the other day."

Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.

"It would be something remarkable, now," he continued, "something
droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the
same time. And yet it is not very unlikely."

"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with resolution, "going to be
married?"

"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.
He has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost
liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if
the match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter
of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable
connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place
in time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away,
to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give
you another instance of her liberality:&mdash;The other day, as soon as we
came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just
now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two
hundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a
great expense while we are here."

He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to
say&mdash;

"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be
considerable; but your income is a large one."

"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to
complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope
will in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying
on, is a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase
within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place,
where old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for[198] me
in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I
felt it my duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my
conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his
convenience; and it has cost me a vast deal of money."

"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth."

"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for
more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have
been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,
that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's
hands, I must have sold out to very great loss."

Elinor could only smile.

"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming
to Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the
Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they
were) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he
had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose,
but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large
purchases of linen, china, &amp;c. to supply the place of what was taken
away. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be
from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is."

"Certainly," said Elinor; "and assisted by her liberality, I hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances."

"Another year or two may do much towards it," he gravely replied; "but
however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone
laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the
flower-garden marked out."

"Where is the green-house to be?"

"Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many
parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before
it, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns
that grew in patches over the brow."

Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very
thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.

Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to[199] do away the
necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in
his next visit at Gray's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he
began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.

"She seems a most valuable woman indeed&mdash;Her house, her style of
living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an
acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but
in the end may prove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town
is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks
altogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she
dies you will not be forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave."

"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her
jointure, which will descend to her children."

"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few
people of common prudence will do that; and whatever she saves, she
will be able to dispose of."

"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her
daughters, than to us?"

"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I
cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.
Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and
treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on
her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not
disregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can
hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises."

"But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far."

"Why, to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect himself, "people have
little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is
the matter with Marianne?&mdash;she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,
and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?"

"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several
weeks."

"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever! Her's has been a very short one! She was
as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to
attract the man. There[200] was something in her style of beauty, to
please them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would
marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly
fond of you, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken,
however. I question whether Marianne now, will marry a man worth
more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very
much deceived if you do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very
little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly
glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having
Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your
visitors."

Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no
likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from
Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
of atoning for his own neglect.

They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John
came in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on
all sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood
did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very
good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his
appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood
went away delighted with both.

"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny," said he, as he
walked back with his sister. "Lady Middleton is really a most elegant
woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.
Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant
as her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of
visiting her, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case,
and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow
of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs.
Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed,[201] that neither she nor her
daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate
with. But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."




CHAPTER XXXIV


Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment,
that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her
daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means
unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of
the most charming women in the world!

Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a
kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually
attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.

The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the
good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs.
Jennings, and to her she appeared nothing more than a little
proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's
sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to
say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley
Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.

Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not choose to ask,
whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny
voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that
his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's
expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed
them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The
intelligence however, which she would not give, soon flowed from
another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion
on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.
and Mrs.[202] Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear
of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to
be told, they could do nothing at present but write.

Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short
time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on
the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. Elinor
was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had
missed him.

The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons,
that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined
to give them&mdash;a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,
invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very
good house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were
invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel
Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were,
received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more
pleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn
whether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing
her, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement;
for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong
anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though
she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of
herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her
curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.

The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon
afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing
that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.

So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so
agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was
certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as
ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit
Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss
Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their
visit should begin a few days before the party took place.

Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the[203] nieces of
the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother,
might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her
table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,
who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a
nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have
an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier
in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.

On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to
determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his
mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the
first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!&mdash;she hardly
knew how she could bear it!

These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and
certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her
own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself
to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward
certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal
when they were together.

The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable mother-in-law.

"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs
together&mdash;for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,
that they all followed the servant at the same time&mdash;"There is nobody
here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good
gracious!&mdash;In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness
depends on&mdash;that is to be my mother!"&mdash;

Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own,
whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured
her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her&mdash;to the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.

Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to[204] formality, in
her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her
complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and
naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of
many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to
the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,
not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the
spirited determination of disliking her at all events.

Elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months
ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs.
Ferrars' power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her
manners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made
to humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see
the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very
person&mdash;for Lucy was particularly distinguished&mdash;whom of all others,
had they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious
to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound
them, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a
graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited
folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with
which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly
despising them all four.

Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss
Steele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly
happy.

The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every
thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's
ability to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions
which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner
having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell
out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had
tried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind, except of
conversation, appeared; but there, the deficiency was considerable.
John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,
and his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar[205] disgrace in
this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors,
who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications
for being agreeable&mdash;Want of sense, either natural or improved&mdash;want
of elegance&mdash;want of spirits&mdash;or want of temper.

When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this
poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen had supplied the
discourse with some variety&mdash;the variety of politics, inclosing land,
and breaking horses&mdash;but then it was all over; and one subject only
engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative
heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William,
who were nearly of the same age.

Had both the children been there, the affair might have been
determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was
present, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every
body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to
repeat it over and over again as often as they liked.

The parties stood thus:&mdash;

The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the
tallest, politely decided in favour of the other. The two
grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were
equally earnest in support of their own descendant.

Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could
not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as
fast as she could, in favour of each.

Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which
she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when
called on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she had no
opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.

Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty
pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted
and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these
screens, catching the eye of John[206] Dashwood on his following the other
gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel
Brandon for his admiration.

"These are done by my eldest sister," said he; "and you, as a man of
taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well."

The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by
Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,
not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look
at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
Middleton's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,
considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by
Miss Dashwood.

"Hum"&mdash;said Mrs. Ferrars&mdash;"very pretty,"&mdash;and without regarding them
at all, returned them to her daughter.

Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude
enough,&mdash;for, colouring a little, she immediately said&mdash;

"They are very pretty, ma'am&mdash;an't they?" But then again, the dread of
having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over
her, for she presently added, "Do you not think they are something in
Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?&mdash;She does paint most
delightfully!&mdash;How beautifully her last landscape is done!"

"Beautifully indeed! But she does every thing well."

Marianne could not bear this. She was already greatly displeased with
Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's
expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant
by it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth&mdash;

"This is admiration of a very particular kind! what is Miss Morton to
us? who knows, or who cares, for her?&mdash;it is Elinor of whom we think
and speak."

And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands,
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.
[207]


Mrs. Ferrars.


Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself [208]up more
stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, "Miss
Morton is Lord Morton's daughter."

Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at
his sister's audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth
than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as
they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was
amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a
sister slighted in the smallest point.

Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.
Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart
taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's
chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to
hers, said in a low, but eager, voice&mdash;

"Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them. Don't let them make you
unhappy."

She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her
face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body's
attention was called, and almost every body was concerned. Colonel
Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did. Mrs.
Jennings, with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave
her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the
author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to
one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account
of the whole shocking affair.

In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits
retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.

"Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
as soon as he could secure his attention: "She has not such good
health as her sister,&mdash;she is very nervous,&mdash;she has not Elinor's
constitution;&mdash;and one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal
attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne was
remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now
you see it is all gone."




[209]
CHAPTER XXXV


Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in
her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her
meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise
free;&mdash;and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own
sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any
other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence
upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least,
if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being
fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she
ought to have rejoiced.

She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of Mrs. Ferrars;&mdash;that her interest and her vanity should so
very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid
her because she was not Elinor appear a compliment to herself&mdash;or to
allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,
because her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not
only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over
again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady
Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing
Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.

The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon
after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.

"My dear friend," cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, "I
come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering
as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable
as she was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the
very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her
behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a[210] fancy to
me. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck
with it?"

"She was certainly very civil to you."

"Civil!&mdash;Did you see nothing but only civility?&mdash;I saw a vast deal
more. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!&mdash;No pride,
no hauteur, and your sister just the same&mdash;all sweetness and
affability!"

Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to
own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to
go on.

"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement," said she, "nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of you;&mdash;but as that was
not the case&mdash;"

"I guessed you would say so," replied Lucy quickly&mdash;"but there was no
reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she
did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan't talk me out of
my satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no
difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a
charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,
indeed!&mdash;I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.
Dashwood was!"

To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.

"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?&mdash;you seem low&mdash;you don't speak;&mdash;sure you
an't well."

"I never was in better health."

"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I
should be sorry to have you ill; you, that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world!&mdash;Heaven knows what I should have done
without your friendship."&mdash;

Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied&mdash;

"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to
Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward!&mdash;But
now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty
often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall
be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half
his time with his sister&mdash;besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars
will visit[211] now;&mdash;and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good
to say more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are
such charming women!&mdash;I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I
think of her, you cannot speak too high."

But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she
should tell her sister. Lucy continued.

"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took
a dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for
instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice
of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way&mdash;you know what I
mean&mdash;if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should
have gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where
she does dislike, I know it is most violent."

Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars,
and Edward's immediately walking in.

It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that
it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to
advance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest
form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had
fallen on them. They were not only all three together, but were
together without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered
themselves first. It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward,
and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could
therefore only look her tenderness, and after slightly addressing
him, said no more.

But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and
her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's
recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost
easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still
improved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from
saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much
regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.
She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as
a friend and almost a relation, were his due,[212] by the observant eyes
of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.

Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage
enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the
ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his
sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of
Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.

Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;
and almost every thing that was said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health,
their coming to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
but never did.

Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching
Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,
and that in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several
minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude,
before she went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it
was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy
hurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing
him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and
strongly spoken. She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a
voice that expressed the affection of a sister.

"Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness!&mdash;This
would almost make amends for every thing!"

Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such
witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all
sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence. Edward was the first
to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express
his fear of her not finding London agree with her.

"Oh, don't think of me!" she replied with spirited earnestness, though
her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, "don't think of my
health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both."[213]

This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
very benignant expression.

"Do you like London?" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject.

"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.
The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and
thank Heaven! you are what you always were!"

She paused&mdash;no one spoke.

"I think, Elinor," she presently added, "we must employ Edward to take
care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we
shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge."

Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even
himself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace
it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,
and soon talked of something else.

"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so
wretchedly dull!&mdash;But I have much to say to you on that head, which
cannot be said now."

And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her
being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in
private.

"But why were you not there, Edward?&mdash;Why did you not come?"

"I was engaged elsewhere."

"Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?"

"Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on
her, "you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have
no mind to keep them, little as well as great."

Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting; for she calmly replied&mdash;

"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that
conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe
he has the most delicate conscience in the world; the most
scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however
it may make against his interest[214] or pleasure. He is the most fearful
of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of
being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will
say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!&mdash;Then you must
be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem,
must submit to my open commendation."

The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened
to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her
auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon
got up to go away.

"Going so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward, this must not be."

And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy
could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he
would go; and Lucy, who would have outstayed him, had his visit lasted
two hours, soon afterwards went away.

"What can bring her here so often?" said Marianne, on her leaving
them. "Could not she see that we wanted her gone!&mdash;how teasing to
Edward!"

"Why so?&mdash;we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known
to him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as
well as ourselves."

Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, "You know, Elinor, that
this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to
have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case,
you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do
it. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not
really wanted."

She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,
for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give
no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the
consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was
obliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward
would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing
Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meeting&mdash;and this she had
every reason to expect.

[215]



Drawing him a little aside.





[216]
CHAPTER XXXVI


Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the
world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a
son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before.

This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a
like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished
to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every
morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in
the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the
Middletons, spent the whole of every day, in Conduit Street. For their
own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the
morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged
against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over
to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in
fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.

They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
their ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to
monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's
behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.
Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not
believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she
fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to
be satirical; but that did not signify. It was censure in common
use, and easily given.

Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the
idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would
despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
three,[217] by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her
to it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and
minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr.
Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the
sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their
arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though
she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and
more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before
Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the
former, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might
have made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about
the Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined
to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a
whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what
she was kind enough to bestow on herself.

All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally
unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young
friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at
her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent
spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well
doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail
of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.
One thing did disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.
Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his
sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly
perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between
this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no
convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was
not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even
be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the
finest child in the world.

I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time
befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters
with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another
of her acquaintance had dropt in&mdash;a[218] circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations
of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present
instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss
Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she
immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a
small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that
Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly
great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods,
but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness
of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that
they might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of
disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's. But that was
not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which
they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any
thing better from them.

Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of
going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to
her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and
mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting
the smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till
the last moment, where it was to take her.

To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as
not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her
toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes
of their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped her
minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and
asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every
part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns
altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not
without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing
cost per week, and how much she had every year[219] to spend upon herself.
The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally
concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was
considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the
colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost
sure of being told that upon "her word she looked vastly smart, and
she dared to say she would make a great many conquests."

With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present
occasion, to her brother's carriage; which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house
of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.

The events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like
other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;
and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in
England.

As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no
scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of
young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on
toothpick-cases at Gray's. She perceived him soon afterwards looking
at herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just
determined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came
towards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert
Ferrars.

He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow
which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was
exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy
had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his
own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his
brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
ill-humour[220] of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she
wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that
the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other. Why they were different, Robert
exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's
conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme
gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper
society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;
while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material
superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.

"Upon my soul," he added, "I believe it is nothing more; and so I
often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. 'My dear Madam,'
I always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy. The evil is now
irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you
be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to
place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his
life? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,
instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been
prevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and
my mother is perfectly convinced of her error."

Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her
general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not
think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.

"You reside in Devonshire, I think,"&mdash;was his next observation, "in a
cottage near Dawlish."

Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather
surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without
living near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on
their species of house.

"For my own part," said he, "I am excessively fond of a cottage; there
is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,
if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one
myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself
down[221] at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I
advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend
Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,
and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's. I was to decide
on the best of them. 'My dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwing
them all into the fire, 'do not adopt either of them, but by all means
build a cottage.' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.

"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in
a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend
Elliott's, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. 'But
how can it be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is
to be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
couple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that there
could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not
be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;
card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the
saloon.' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the
dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you
see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be
as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling."

Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the
compliment of rational opposition.

As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,
his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a
thought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his
wife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of
Mrs. Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,
while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home. The expense
would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his
father. Fanny was startled at the proposal.[222]

"I do not see how it can be done," said she, "without affronting Lady
Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be
exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But
they are Lady Middleton's visitors. How can I ask them away from her?"

Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her
objection. "They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit
Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations."

Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said&mdash;

"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend
a few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls;
and I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very
well by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but
the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like
them; indeed, you do like them, you know, very much already, and so
does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!"

Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as
their visitor.

Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company
and her sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady
Middleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and
reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,
herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such
an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all
things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the
most gratifying to her feelings! It[223] was an advantage that could not
be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the
visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,
was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'
time.

When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the
expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will
towards her arose from something more than merely malice against
herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
that Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater.

The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.
Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such
accounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.
Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in
her life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book
made by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not
know whether she should ever be able to part with them.




CHAPTER XXXVII


Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother
felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her;
and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day,
returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in
which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former
share.

About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit
to Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by
herself, with an air of such hurrying[224] importance as prepared her to
hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,
began directly to justify it, by saying&mdash;

"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?"

"No, ma'am. What is it?"

"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.
Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was
sure it was very ill&mdash;it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.
So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it is
nothing in the world, but the red gum&mdash;' and nurse said just the same.
But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent
for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he
stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said
just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and
then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it
came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of
it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon
that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I
believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will
do very well.'"

"What! is Fanny ill?"
[225]


In a whisper.


"That is exactly what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs.
Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of
the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,
the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it
turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.
Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to
my cousin Lucy! There's for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a
thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;
but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody
suspect it! That is strange! I never happened to see them together,
or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and [226]so this
was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor
your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very
morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no
conjurer, popt it all out. 'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are
all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about
it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone
at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come&mdash;for she had
just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she
thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or
other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her
vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with
such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his
own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his
steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene
took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming
what was going on. Poor soul! I pity her. And I must say, I think
she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and
soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees,
and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and
said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should
not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to
go down upon his knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till
they had packed up their clothes. Then she fell into hysterics
again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,
and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was
at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just
stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,
she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I
have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it
will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward
will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully!
for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not
wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!&mdash;and Mr. Donavan
thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and
the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that
he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it,[227] for she was
sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister
was sure she would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I
care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's
making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on
earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs.
Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has
next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make
the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow
him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it
as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in
such another cottage as yours&mdash;or a little bigger&mdash;with two maids, and
two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty
has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly."

Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to
collect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make
such observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to
produce. Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary
interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped
might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to
Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she
felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and
to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the
conduct of every one concerned in it.

She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event
really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its
being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of
Edward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there
could not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still
more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For him she
felt much compassion;&mdash;for Lucy very little&mdash;and it cost her some
pains to procure that little;&mdash;for the rest of the party none at all.

As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be
lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,
and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she[228] felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any
resentment against Edward.

Elinor's office was a painful one. She was going to remove what she
really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,&mdash;to give such
particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her
good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their
situations, which to her fancy would seem strong, feel all her own
disappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it
was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.

She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to
represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's
engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given
without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
impetuous grief. That belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure
of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge
but of imprudence, was readily offered.

But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed
a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she had
loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for
Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded
at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
Edward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and
Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.

Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed. Marianne's
feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of
detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her
distress, lessen her alarms, and combat[229] her resentment. The first
question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was&mdash;

"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?"

"I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton
Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement."

At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her
lips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed&mdash;

"Four months!&mdash;Have you known of this four months?"

Elinor confirmed it.

"What!&mdash;while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your
heart?&mdash;And I have reproached you for being happy!"&mdash;

"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!"

"Four months!" cried Marianne again. "So calm! so cheerful! how have
you been supported?"

"By feeling that I was doing my duty. My promise to Lucy, obliged me
to be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of
the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in
them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to
satisfy."

Marianne seemed much struck.

"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother," added
Elinor; "and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying
my trust, I never could have convinced you."

"Four months! and yet you loved him!"

"Yes. But I did not love only him;&mdash;and while the comfort of others
was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.
Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have
you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer
materially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not
conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of
my own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it
farther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very
happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now
he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does
not want sense, and[230] that is the foundation on which every thing good
may be built. And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in
the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said
of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is
not meant&mdash;it is not fit&mdash;it is not possible that it should be so.
Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and
understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to
forget that he ever thought another superior to her."

"If such is your way of thinking," said Marianne, "if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your
resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be
wondered at. They are brought more within my comprehension."

"I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For
four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained
to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told
me,&mdash;it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose
prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,
with triumph. This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to
oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most
deeply interested;&mdash;and it has not been only once;&mdash;I have had her
hopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself
to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance
that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him
unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me. I have had
to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of
his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without
enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,
when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If
you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that
I have suffered now. The composure of mind with which I have brought
myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have
been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful
exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to
relieve my[231] spirits at first. No, Marianne. Then, if I had not been
bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely&mdash;not
even what I owed to my dearest friends&mdash;from openly showing that I was
very unhappy."&mdash;

Marianne was quite subdued.

"Oh! Elinor," she cried, "you have made me hate myself for ever. How
barbarous have I been to you!&mdash;you, who have been my only comfort, who
have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
suffering for me! Is this my gratitude? Is this the only return I can
make you? Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
to do it away."

The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of
mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her
whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness;&mdash;to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her;&mdash;and even to see Edward himself, if chance should
bring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.
These were great concessions;&mdash;but where Marianne felt that she had
injured, no reparation could be too much for her to make.

She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration. She
attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with
an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard
three times to say, "Yes, ma'am."&mdash;She listened to her praise of Lucy
with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.
Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to
any thing herself.

The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their
brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair, and bring them news of his wife.

"You have heard, I suppose," said he with great solemnity, as soon as
he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday."

They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.
[232]


&quot;You have heard, I suppose.&quot;


"Your sister," he continued, "has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars
too&mdash;in short it has been a scene of such complicated [233]distress&mdash;but
I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of
us quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But
I would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing
materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her
resolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the
fortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody
again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!&mdash;meeting
with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much
confidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her
heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely
because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,
well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we
both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us,
while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to
be so rewarded! 'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her
affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'"

Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.

"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is
not to be described. While she with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed
that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another
person!&mdash;such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she
suspected any prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in that
quarter. 'There to be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself
safe.' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as
to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.
He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars
could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as
you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of
no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never
thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained
to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told
him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of
land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters
grew desperate, to make it[234] twelve hundred; and in opposition to this,
if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the
certain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds
she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so
far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if
he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support,
she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it."

Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands
together, and cried, "Gracious God! can this be possible!"

"Well may you wonder, Marianne," replied her brother, "at the
obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation
is very natural."

Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and
forbore.

"All this, however," he continued, "was urged in vain. Edward said
very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.
Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would
stand to it, cost him what it might."

"Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be
silent, "he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.
Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a
rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as
yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good
husband."

John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not
open to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially
anybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any
resentment&mdash;

"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,
madam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,
but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under
her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large
fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little
extraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour
of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We[235] all wish
her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole,
has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like
circumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward
has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one."

Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung
for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a
woman who could not reward him.

"Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did it end?"

"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:&mdash;Edward is
dismissed for ever from his mother's notice. He left her house
yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do
not know; for we of course can make no inquiry."

"Poor young man!&mdash;and what is to become of him?"

"What, indeed, ma'am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the
prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds&mdash;how can a man live on
it?&mdash;and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but
for his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand
pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must
all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our
power to assist him."

"Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure he should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I
could see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own
charge now, at lodgings and taverns."

Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though
she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.

"If he would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood,
"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been
in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it
is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him. And there is one
thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all&mdash;his
mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle
that estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's,
on proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer,
talking over the business."
[236]


Talking over the business.

[237]
"Well!" said Mrs. Jennings, "that is her revenge. Everybody has a
way of their own. But I don't think mine would be, to make one son
independent, because another had plagued me."

Marianne got up and walked about the room.

"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man," continued John,
"than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which
might have been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely."

A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his
visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really
believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the
Dashwoods', and Edward's.

Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and
as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party.




CHAPTER XXXVIII


Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but
only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. They only knew
how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small
was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that
could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried
in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion
for his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this
public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject
on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor
avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her
thoughts, by the too warm,[238] too positive assurances of Marianne, that
belief of Edward's continued affection for herself which she rather
wished to do away; and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying
to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with
herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between
Elinor's conduct and her own.

She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had
hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of
continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never
exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,
without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she
still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only
dispirited her more.

Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs
in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings. But though so much of the
matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had
enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking
after more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort
and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the
hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them
within that time.

The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so
fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,
though it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor
were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were
again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather
to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.

An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they
entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing
with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was
herself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last
she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,
though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a[239] short time, to join their's.
Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor&mdash;

"Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you
ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke."

It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too,
that she would tell any thing without being asked; for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt.

"I am so glad to meet you;" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by
the arm&mdash;"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world." And
then lowering her voice, "I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about
it. Is she angry?"

"Not at all, I believe, with you."

"That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is she angry?"

"I cannot suppose it possible that she should."

"I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of
it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she
would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me
again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are
as good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put
in the feather last night. There now, you are going to laugh at me
too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it is
the Doctor's favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never
have known he did like it better than any other colour, if he had
not happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare
sometimes I do not know which way to look before them."

She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to
the first.

"Well, but Miss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly, "people may say what
they choose about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for
it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such
ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think
about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set
it down for certain."

"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,"
said Elinor.
[240]


&quot;She put in the feather last night.&quot;


"Oh, did not you? But it was said, I know, very well, [241]and by more
than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses
could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with
thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had
nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides
that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point
he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come
near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I
believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away
from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of
him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose
against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from
church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday
to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them,
and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy,
and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by
what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,
he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or
other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday,
on purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and
over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,
and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the
engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but
two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to
go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a
curacy, and how was they to live upon that?&mdash;He could not bear to
think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least
mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift
for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.
And it was entirely for her sake, and upon her account, that he
said a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath
he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to
marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would
not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a
great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all[242] that&mdash;Oh, la! one
can't repeat such kind of things you know)&mdash;she told him directly, she
had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with
him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be
very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then
he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should
do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait
to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any
more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was
come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so
I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if
she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just
run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with
the Richardsons."

"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them," said Elinor;
"you were all in the same room together, were not you?"

"No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love
when any body else is by? Oh, for shame!&mdash;To be sure you must know
better than that. (Laughing affectedly.)&mdash;No, no; they were shut up in
the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at
the door."

"How!" cried Elinor; "have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it
before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?"

"Oh, la! there is nothing in that. I only stood at the door, and
heard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same
by me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many
secrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or
behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said."

Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.
[243]


Listening at the door.


"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon," said she; "but now he is
lodging at No. &mdash;, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,
an't she? And your [244]brother and sister were not very kind! However, I
shan't say anything against them to you; and to be sure they did
send us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.
And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask
us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,
nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of
sight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go
there for a time; and after that, as soon as he can light upon a
Bishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good
gracious! (giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what my
cousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should
write to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I
know they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the
world. 'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of
such a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!'"

"Well," said Elinor, "it is a comfort to be prepared against the
worst. You have got your answer ready."

Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach
of her own party made another more necessary.

"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to
you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you
they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and
they keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings
about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not
in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything
should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings
should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay
with her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton
won't ask us any more this bout. Good-bye; I am sorry Miss Marianne was
not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your
spotted muslin on!&mdash;I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn."

Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay
her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was
claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though
she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen
and foreplanned[245] in her own mind. Edward's marriage with Lucy was as
firmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as
absolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;&mdash;every thing
depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that
preferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest
chance.

As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for
information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,
she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple
particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own
consequence, would choose to have known. The continuance of their
engagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its
end, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings
the following natural remark:&mdash;

"Wait for his having a living!&mdash;ay, we all know how that will
end:&mdash;they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,
will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest
of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.
Pratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord
help 'em! how poor they will be!&mdash;I must see what I can give them
towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed!&mdash;as I
talked of t'other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all
works. Betty's sister would never do for them now."

The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from
Lucy herself. It was as follows:

"Bartlett's Building, March.

"I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take
of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will
make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and
my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through
lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed
to say that, thank God! though we have suffered dreadfully,
we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always
be in one another's love. We have had great trials, and
great persecutions, but however, at the same time,
gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least
among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully
remember,[246] as will Edward too, who I have told of it. I am
sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs.
Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday
afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though
earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to
it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the
spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never
be, he did not regard his mother's anger, while he could
have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be
sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be
ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to
recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am
very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings
too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or
Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.
Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it
for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't
think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come
this way any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and my
cousins would be proud to know her. My paper reminds me to
conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully
remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and
the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to
Miss Marianne,

"I am, etc., etc."

As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to
be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.
Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and
praise.

"Very well indeed!&mdash;how prettily she writes!&mdash;aye, that was quite
proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor
soul! I wish I could get him a living, with all my heart. She calls
me dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever
lived. Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned.
Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to
think of every body!&mdash;Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as
pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great
credit."




[247]
CHAPTER XXXIX


The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed
for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that
if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less
bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of
the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be
brought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her
thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their
wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence
of her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining
them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether
much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to
Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs.
Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from
Charlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been
sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;&mdash;but it was enforced
with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the
very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had
been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.

When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was
not very auspicious.

"Cleveland!"&mdash;she cried, with great agitation. "No, I cannot go to
Cleveland."&mdash;

"You forget," said Elinor gently, "that its situation is not&mdash;that it
is not in the neighbourhood of&mdash;"

"But it is in Somersetshire. I cannot go into Somersetshire. There,
where I looked forward to going;&mdash;no, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
go there."

Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings;&mdash;she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others;&mdash;represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
time of her returning to that dear mother,[248] whom she so much wished to
see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which
was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's
servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there
could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they
might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time. As
Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with
little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.

Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest, that she
pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.
Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her
design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could
be;&mdash;and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the
hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.

"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss
Dashwoods;"&mdash;was Mrs. Jennings's address to him when he first called
on her, after their leaving her was settled&mdash;"for they are quite
resolved upon going home from the Palmers;&mdash;and how forlorn we shall
be, when I come back!&mdash;Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as
dull as two cats."

Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give
himself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good
reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she
was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of
particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.
The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her
observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even
changed her seat, on purpose that she might not hear, to one close
by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep
herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her
employment. Still farther in[249] confirmation of her hopes, in the
interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words
of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a
doubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply
she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips,
that she did not think that any material objection;&mdash;and Mrs.
Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. They then
talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable,
when another lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these
words in the Colonel's calm voice,&mdash;

"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."

Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost
ready to cry out, "Lord! what should hinder it?"&mdash;but checking her
desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.

"This is very strange!&mdash;sure he need not wait to be older."

This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or
mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to
feel what she said&mdash;

"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you."

Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take
leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and
go away without making her any reply!&mdash;She had not thought her old
friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.

What had really passed between them was to this effect.

"I have heard," said he, with great compassion, "of the injustice your
friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand
the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for
persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have
I been rightly informed?&mdash;Is it so?&mdash;"

Elinor told him that it was.

"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"&mdash;he replied, with great
feeling,&mdash;"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people[250]
long attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know
what she may be doing&mdash;what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr.
Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with
him. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for
his own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I
understand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to
tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am
informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his
acceptance&mdash;but that, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he
is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were
more valuable. It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I
believe, did not make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is
certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to
afford him a very comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my
pleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him
of it."

Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.
The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as
hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;&mdash;and
she, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!&mdash;Her
emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
cause;&mdash;but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might
have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,
and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together
prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly
expressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of
Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew
them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short,
from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from her, she would have been very glad to be spared
herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining
it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her
means,[251] that she would not on any account make farther opposition.
Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard
his address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform
him of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled,
Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and then it was that he
mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent; an
evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very
light of, at least as far as regarded its size.

"The smallness of the house," said she, "I cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family
and income."

By which the Colonel was surprised to find that she was considering
Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;
for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply
such an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to
settle on, and he said so.

"This little rectory can do no more than make Mr. Ferrars
comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry
to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly
more extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in
my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him
from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I
sincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed,
seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what
must be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must
still be a distant good;&mdash;at least, I am afraid it cannot take place
very soon."

Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended
the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of
what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they
stood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their
parting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,
nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of
marriage.




[252]
CHAPTER XL


"Well, Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as
soon as the gentleman had withdrawn, "I do not ask you what the
Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I tried
to keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand
his business. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life,
and I wish you joy of it with all my heart."

"Thank you, ma'am," said Elinor. "It is a matter of great joy to me;
and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are
not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so
compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life."

"Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an't the least astonished at it
in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more
likely to happen."

"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence;
but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
soon occur."

"Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings&mdash;"Oh! as to that, when a man has
once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon
find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and
again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I
shall soon know where to look for them."

"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose," said Elinor, with a
faint smile.

"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,
I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as
ever I saw."

"He spoke of its being out of repair."

"Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he repair it? who should do
it but himself?"

They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the
carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to
go, said&mdash;

"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half[253] my talk out.
But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be
quite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind
is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must
long to tell your sister all about it."

Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.

"Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not
mention it at present to any body else."

"Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. "Then you
would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as
Holborn to-day."

"No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day's delay will not be
very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it
ought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do that
directly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him,
for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination."

This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr.
Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she
could not immediately comprehend. A few moments' reflection, however,
produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed&mdash;

"Oh, ho! I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much
the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;
and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my
dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel
write himself? Sure, he is the proper person."

Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's
speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore
only replied to its conclusion.

"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one
to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself."

"And so you are forced to do it. Well that is an odd kind of
delicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to
write.) You know your own concerns best. So good-bye, my dear. I have
not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was
brought to bed."

And away she went; but returning again in a moment&mdash;

"I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear. I[254] should be
very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for
a lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell. She is an excellent housemaid,
and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that
at your leisure."

"Certainly, ma'am," replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,
and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.

How she should begin&mdash;how she should express herself in her note to
Edward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between
them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too
much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen
in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.

He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he
came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not
returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss
Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular
business.

Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her
perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her
upon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion
were very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him
before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his
knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of
what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much
distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment. Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on
first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to
be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could
say any thing, after taking a chair.

"Mrs. Jennings told me," said he, "that you wished to speak with me,
at least I understood her so&mdash;or I certainly should not have intruded
on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been
extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;
especially as it[255] will most likely be some time&mdash;it is not probable
that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to
Oxford tomorrow."

"You would not have gone, however," said Elinor, recovering herself,
and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as
possible, "without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been
able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she
said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on
the point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most
agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)
Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to
say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure
in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only
wishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having
so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that
the living&mdash;it is about two hundred a-year&mdash;were much more
considerable, and such as might better enable you to&mdash;as might be more
than a temporary accommodation to yourself&mdash;such, in short, as might
establish all your views of happiness."

What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be
expected that any one else should say for him. He looked all the
astonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information
could not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words&mdash;

"Colonel Brandon!"

"Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the
worst was over, "Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his
concern for what has lately passed&mdash;for the cruel situation in which
the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you&mdash;a concern
which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share;
and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character,
and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present
occasion."

"Colonel Brandon give me a living!&mdash;Can it be possible?"

"The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
friendship any where."

"No," replied be, with sudden consciousness, "not to find it in you;
for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness,[256] I owe it all.
I feel it&mdash;I would express it if I could&mdash;but, as you well know, I am
no orator."

"You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,
at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's
discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till
I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever
occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a
friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps&mdash;indeed I know he has,
still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe
nothing to my solicitation."

Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but
she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently
entered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had
ceased to speak;&mdash;at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he
said&mdash;

"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have
always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems
him highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners
perfectly the gentleman."

"Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you will find him, on
farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you
will be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is
almost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that
he should be all this."

Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her
a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that
he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the
mansion-house much greater.

"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street," said he, soon
afterwards, rising from his chair.

Elinor told him the number of the house.

"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not
allow me to give you; to assure him that he has made me a very&mdash;an
exceedingly happy man."

Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very
earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing good wishes for his
happiness in every change of situation that[257] might befall him; on
his, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the
power of expressing it.

"When I see him again," said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him
out, "I shall see him the husband of Lucy."

And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the
past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of
Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.

When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people
whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a
great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important
secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to
it again as soon as Elinor appeared.

"Well, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up the young man. Did not I do
right?&mdash;And I suppose you had no great difficulty&mdash;You did not find
him very unwilling to accept your proposal?"

"No, ma'am; that was not very likely."

"Well, and how soon will he be ready?&mdash;For it seems all to depend upon
that."

"Really," said Elinor, "I know so little of these kind of forms, that
I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation
necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his
ordination."

"Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "Lord! my dear, how calmly
you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord
bless me!&mdash;I am sure it would put me quite out of patience!&mdash;And
though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I
do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.
Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that
is in orders already."

"My dear ma'am," said Elinor, "what can you be thinking of? Why,
Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

"Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the
Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.
Ferrars!"
[258]


Both gained considerable amusement


The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation
immediately took place, by which both [259]gained considerable amusement
for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for
Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and
still without forfeiting her expectation of the first.

"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one," said she, after the
first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, "and very
likely may be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I
thought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on
the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up
fifteen beds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton
cottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the
Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for
them, before Lucy goes to it."

"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's
being enough to allow them to marry."

"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year
himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word
for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford
Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't
there."

Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not
waiting for any thing more.




CHAPTER XLI


Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with
his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he
reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.
Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her
congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in
her life.

Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain;
and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their
being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before
Michaelmas. So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to
give Elinor that credit[260] which Edward would give her, that she spoke
of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was
ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no
exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or
future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing
any thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel
Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was
moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly
concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and
scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she
possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his
poultry.

It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his
wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her a visit. This was an obligation, however,
which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to
prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her
carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.
John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after
the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking
Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company
again. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run
the risk of a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with a woman, whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike.

Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the
house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure
in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in
Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to
see her, invited her to come in.

They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room. Nobody was there.

"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose," said he:&mdash;"I will go to her
presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the
world to seeing you. Very far from it, indeed. Now especially
there cannot be&mdash;but however, you[261] and Marianne were always great
favourites. Why would not Marianne come?"&mdash;

Elinor made what excuse she could for her.

"I am not sorry to see you alone," he replied, "for I have a good deal
to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon's&mdash;can it be true?&mdash;has
he really given it to Edward?&mdash;I heard it yesterday by chance, and was
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."

"It is perfectly true. Colonel Brandon has given the living of
Delaford to Edward."

"Really!&mdash;Well, this is very astonishing!&mdash;no relationship!&mdash;no
connection between them!&mdash;and now that livings fetch such a
price!&mdash;what was the value of this?"

"About two hundred a year."

"Very well&mdash;and for the next presentation to a living of that
value&mdash;supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and
likely to vacate it soon&mdash;he might have got I dare say&mdash;fourteen
hundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before
this person's death? Now indeed it would be too late to sell it, but
a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!&mdash;I wonder he should be so
improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!&mdash;Well, I
am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost
every human character. I suppose, however&mdash;on recollection&mdash;that the
case may probably be this. Edward is only to hold the living till
the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is
old enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."

Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that
she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.

"It is truly astonishing!"&mdash;he cried, after hearing what she
said&mdash;"what could be the Colonel's motive?"

"A very simple one&mdash;to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky
man. You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I
have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,&mdash;she will not like
to hear it much talked of."

Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that[262] she
thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of
wealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be
possibly impoverished.

"Mrs. Ferrars," added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject, "knows nothing about it at present, and I believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may
be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all."

"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be
supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,&mdash;for that must
be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she
supposed to feel at all? She has done with her son, she cast him off
for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast
him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined
liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account&mdash;she
cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be
so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the
anxiety of a parent!"

"Ah! Elinor," said John, "your reasoning is very good, but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match
takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had
never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as
possible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."

"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her
memory by this time."

"You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world."

Elinor was silent.

"We think now,"&mdash;said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, "of
Robert's marrying Miss Morton."

Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's
tone, calmly replied&mdash;

"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."

"Choice!&mdash;how do you mean?"

"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be
the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert."[263]

"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;&mdash;and as to any
thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that
one is superior to the other."

Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent. His
reflections ended thus.

"Of one thing, my dear sister," kindly taking her hand, and speaking
in an awful whisper,&mdash;"I may assure you; and I will do it, because I
know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think&mdash;indeed I have
it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise
it would be very wrong to say any thing about it,&mdash;but I have it from
the very best authority,&mdash;not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars
say it herself&mdash;but her daughter did, and I have it from her,&mdash;that
in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain&mdash;a
certain connection, you understand me,&mdash;it would have been far
preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that
this does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars
considered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know
to us all. 'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the
least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound now for
nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out of the
question,&mdash;not to be thought of or mentioned. As to any attachment you
know, it never could be; all that is gone by. But I thought I would
just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not
that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt
of your doing exceedingly well,&mdash;quite as well, or better, perhaps,
all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?"

Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her
self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;&mdash;and she was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her
brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments'
chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her
sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was
left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the
prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated
course of life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most
unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.
[264]


&quot;Of one thing I may assure you.&quot;

[265]
They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to
speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very
inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very
different, was not less striking than it had been on him. He laughed
most immoderately. The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living
in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;&mdash;and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John
Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.

Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed
on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a
look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,
and gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.

"We may treat it as a joke," said he, at last, recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine
gaiety of the moment; "but, upon my soul, it is a most serious
business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for
it; for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature,&mdash;as
well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge
of him, Miss Dashwood, from your slight acquaintance. Poor Edward!
His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature. But we are not
all born, you know, with the same powers,&mdash;the same address. Poor
fellow! to see him in a circle of strangers! to be sure it was
pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as
any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so
shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe
it. My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling
myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her,&mdash;'My
dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the[266] occasion,
but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young
woman, I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.
I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for
himself completely,&mdash;shut himself out for ever from all decent
society! but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least
surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be
expected. My poor mother was half frantic."

"Have you ever seen the lady?"

"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in
for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward
country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I
remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely
to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother
related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from
the match; but it was too late then, I found, to do any thing, for
unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till
after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to
interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think
it is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly
should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. 'My dear
fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what you are doing. You are
making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family
are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot help thinking, in short, that
means might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be
starved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved."

He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though she
never spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its
influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance
with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour
to herself. She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that
Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to
see more of them;&mdash;an exertion in which her husband, who attended her
into the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to
distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.




[267]
CHAPTER XLII


One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her
brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton
without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to
Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother
and sisters in town;&mdash;and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to
Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all
things was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less
public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which
he should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any
meeting in the country.

It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to
send her to Delaford;&mdash;a place, in which, of all others, she would now
least choose to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it
considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but
even Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit
her there.

Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties
from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective
homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of
Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their
journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel
Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.

Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as
she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point,
bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed
those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now
extinguished for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the
place in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new
schemes, in which she could have no share, without shedding many
tears.

Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.
She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left
no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to
be divided for ever, she was pleased[268] to be free herself from the
persecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing her
sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might
do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.

Their journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into
the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was
it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of
the third they drove up to Cleveland.

Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping
lawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably
extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of
importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of
smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn
was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the
guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick
screen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,
shut out the offices.

Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty
from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its
walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her
child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through
the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a
distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering
over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on
the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their
summits Combe Magna might be seen.

In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears
of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different
circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country
liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious
solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while
she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary
rambles.
[269]


Showing her child to the housekeeper.


She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the
[270]house, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the
rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the
kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to
the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the
green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,
and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of
Charlotte,&mdash;and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the
disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests,
or being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising
young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.

The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment
abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
at Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself
prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had
depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all
over the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have
deterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even she could
not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking.

Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer
had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the
friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements,
and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther
than Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it,
joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding
her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by
the family in general, soon procured herself a book.

Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly
good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The
openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want
of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the
forms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face,
was engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it
was not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her
laugh.
[271]


The gardener&#39;s lamentations.


The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner,
affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a[272] very welcome
variety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same
continued rain had reduced very low.

Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen
so much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she
knew not what to expect to find him in his own family. She found him,
however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him
very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from
being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.
Jennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they
were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all
unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,
uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight
it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been
devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much
better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she
could like him no more; not sorry to be driven by the observation of
his epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple
taste, and diffident feelings.

Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received
intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire
lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of
Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a
great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,
and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them. His
behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his
open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his
readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,
might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,
and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the
first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it
herself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her
head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could not help
believing herself the nicest observer of the two: she watched his
eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour; and while his
looks of anxious[273] solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and
throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
entirely escaped the latter lady's observation,&mdash;she could discover
in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.

Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her
being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all
over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,
where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the
trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,
had&mdash;assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet
shoes and stockings&mdash;given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a
day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all
declined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a
cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her
entirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her,
when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the
remedies.




CHAPTER XLIII


Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry
replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by
engaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting
shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable
to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much
in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed,
more and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her
sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole
day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on
her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of
sleep, and felt no real alarm.

A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned[274] voluntarily to her
bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending
for the Palmers' apothecary.

He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet,
by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing
the word "infection" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs.
Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined
from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor,
now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming
Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate
removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their
apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife
too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and
within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her
little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr.
Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her
husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or
two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to
accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which
made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring
from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,
by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother
she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most
willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues,
and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.

Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and
feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended
the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she then really believed
herself, that it would be a very short one.

The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the[275]
patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no
amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;
for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his
promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel
Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going
likewise. Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most
acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much
uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she
thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his
stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him
to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with
her sister, &amp;c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was
gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not
long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was
warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,
in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss
Dashwood in any emergence.

Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of
Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It
gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it
gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.

Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her
situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who
attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and
Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early
in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel
Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's
forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He
tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of
the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day
in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the
admission of[276] every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his
mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.

On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared
his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed
in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her
letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than
her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed
them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would
be able to travel.

But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the
evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a
slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her
sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself,
she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,
knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to
bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating
herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with
Marianne.

The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her
sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change
of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of
complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from
so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some
accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish
wildness, cried out,&mdash;

"Is mama coming?&mdash;"

"Not yet," cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting
Marianne to lie down again, "but she will be here, I hope, before it
is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton."

"But she must not go round by London," cried Marianne,[277] in the same
hurried manner. "I shall never see her, if she goes by London."

Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while
attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and
quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her
alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly
for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.
To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by
her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.

It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were
immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to
attempt the removal of; he listened to them in silent despondence; but
her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his
mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs.
Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She
thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to
hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for
post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.

The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon&mdash;or
such a companion for her mother,&mdash;how gratefully was it felt!&mdash;a
companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve,
and whose friendship might soothe her!&mdash;as far as the shock of such a
summons could be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his
assistance, would lessen it.

He, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness
of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might
look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The
horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words
spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was
then[278] about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment
to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the
rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.
Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on
Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr.
Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess
for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for
she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her
more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought.

Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her
mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the
heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.

She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if he could
not come, for some other advice, when the former&mdash;but not till after
five o'clock&mdash;arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends
for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to
be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was
communicated to Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious
attendant more composed than he had found them.

With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her
no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,
her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the
comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the
early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have
struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's
compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her
companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been
greatly[279] injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too,
particularly a favourite, was before her;&mdash;and as for their mother,
when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to her
what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in her sufferings was
very sincere.

Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; but he came to be
disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His
medicines had failed; the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more
quiet&mdash;not more herself&mdash;remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching
all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in
further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something
more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as
confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging
assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of
Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;
but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till
noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering
from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her
spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,
who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack
to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's
disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of
the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.

About noon, however, she began&mdash;but with a caution&mdash;a dread of
disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her
friend&mdash;to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her
sister's pulse; she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;
and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior
calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her
hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a
temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a
thought of its continuance; and Elinor, conning over every injunction
of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late.
Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she
bent over her sister to watch&mdash;she hardly knew for what. Half an hour
passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even
arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered
Elinor with signs of[280] amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her
with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed
her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the
arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock; when his assurances, his
felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his
expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her
entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the
partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,
with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the
probability of an entire recovery.

Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led
to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,
friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with
sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
gratitude;&mdash;but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,
no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and
strong.

She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the
whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her
enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every
look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course,
in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was; but when she
saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of
recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,
steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every
doubt.

The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected
back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her
mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must
now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!&mdash;perhaps scarcely
less an object of pity! Oh! how slow was the progress of time which
yet kept them in ignorance!

At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined
Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been
kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden[281] reverse, from eating
much; and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings
would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before
her mother's arrival, and allow her to take her place by Marianne;
but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that
moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an
unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs
into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to
her own room to write letters and sleep.

The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and
the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,
regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the
travellers, they had a rich reward in store, for every present
inconvenience.

The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the
house; and so strong was the persuasion that she did, in spite of
the almost impossibility of their being already come, that she moved
into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be
satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not
deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in
view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be
drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor
mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.

Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the
carriage stopped the door,&mdash;of her doubt&mdash;her dread,&mdash;perhaps her
despair!&mdash;and of what she had to tell! with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;
and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid
with her sister, she hurried down stairs.

The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,
assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the
drawing-room,&mdash;she entered it,&mdash;and saw only Willoughby.

[282]



&quot;Opened a window-shutter.&quot;





[283]
CHAPTER XLIV


Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him,
obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the
room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was
suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of
command than supplication&mdash;

"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour&mdash;for ten minutes&mdash;I entreat you to
stay."

"No, sir," she replied with firmness, "I shall not stay. Your
business cannot be with me. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell
you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house."

"Had they told me," he cried with vehemence, "that Mr. Palmer and all
his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the
door. My business is with you, and only you."

"With me!"&mdash;in the utmost amazement;&mdash;"well, sir&mdash;be quick&mdash;and if you
can&mdash;less violent."

"Sit down, and I will be both."

She hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel
Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had
promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was
engaged. After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that
prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best
promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He
took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by
either.

"Pray be quick, sir," said Elinor, impatiently; "I have no time to
spare."

He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to
hear her.

"Your sister," said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards&mdash;"is out
of danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!&mdash;But is it
true? is it really true?"

Elinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater
eagerness.

"For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?"
[284]



&quot;I entreat you to stay.&quot;


[285]

"We hope she is."

He rose up, and walked across the room.

"Had I known as much half an hour ago&mdash;But since I am
here,"&mdash;speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his
seat,&mdash;"what does it signify?&mdash;For once, Miss Dashwood&mdash;it will be the
last time, perhaps&mdash;let us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood
for gaiety. Tell me honestly,"&mdash;a deeper glow overspreading his
cheeks, "do you think me most a knave or a fool?"

Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to
think that he must be in liquor;&mdash;the strangeness of such a visit, and
of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this
impression she immediately rose, saying&mdash;

"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe&mdash;I am not
at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be
with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow."

"I understand you," he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice
perfectly calm; "yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold
beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me."

"At Marlborough!"&mdash;cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
what he would be at.

"Yes,&mdash;I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten
minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a
nuncheon at Marlborough."

The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he
spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she
said, after a moment's recollection&mdash;

"Mr. Willoughby, you ought to feel, and I certainly do, that after
what has passed&mdash;your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself
upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that
you mean by it?"&mdash;

"I mean,"&mdash;said he, with serious energy&mdash;"if I can, to make you hate
me one degree less than you do now. I mean to offer some kind of
explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole
heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a
blockhead, I have not been[286] always a rascal, to obtain something like
forgiveness from Ma&mdash;&mdash;, from your sister."

"Is this the real reason of your coming?"

"Upon my soul it is," was his answer, with a warmth which brought all
the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made
her think him sincere.

"If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne does,
she has long forgiven you."

"Has she?" he cried, in the same eager tone. "Then she has forgiven me
before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and
on more reasonable grounds. Now will you listen to me?"

Elinor bowed her assent.

"I do not know," said he, after a pause of expectation on her side,
and thoughtfulness on his own, "how you may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,&mdash;it is
worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first
became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other
view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was
obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done
before. Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not
but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a
kind&mdash;It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what she
was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must
confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,
thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had
always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by
every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any
design of returning her affection."

Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most
angry contempt, stopped him, by saying&mdash;

"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for
me to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed
by any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the
subject."

"I insist on you hearing the whole of it," he replied, "My fortune was
never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
associating with people of better income[287] than myself. Every year
since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my
debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set
me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it
had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances
by marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister,
therefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness,
selfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even
of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much,&mdash;I was acting in
this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of
returning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid
state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I
meditated, because I did not then know what it was to love. But have
I ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved,
could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is
more, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it. To avoid a
comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have
deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,
lost every thing that could make it a blessing."

"You did then," said Elinor, a little softened, "believe yourself at
one time attached to her?"

"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!
Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself,
by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours
of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were
strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even then, however,
when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself
most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,
from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my
circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here&mdash;nor
will I stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse
than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was
already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,
providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of
making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my
resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage
her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and
openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains
to[288] display. But in the interim&mdash;in the interim of the very few hours
that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with
her in private&mdash;a circumstance occurred&mdash;an unlucky circumstance&mdash;to
ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took
place,"&mdash;here he hesitated and looked down. "Mrs. Smith had somehow or
other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose
interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a
connection&mdash;but I need not explain myself farther," he added, looking
at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye,&mdash;"your
particular intimacy&mdash;you have probably heard the whole story long
ago."

"I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart
anew against any compassion for him, "I have heard it all. And how you
will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
confess is beyond my comprehension."

"Remember," cried Willoughby, "from whom you received the account.
Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her
character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify
myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
nothing to urge&mdash;that because she was injured she was irreproachable,
and because I was a libertine, she must be a saint. If the
violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding&mdash;I do not
mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better
treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the
tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any
return. I wish&mdash;I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured
more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for
me&mdash;(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose
mind&mdash;Oh! how infinitely superior!"

"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl&mdash;I must say
it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
be&mdash;your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do
not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of
understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.
You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in
Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was
reduced to the extremest indigence."

"But, upon my soul, I did not know it," he warmly replied; "I[289] did
not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common
sense might have told her how to find it out."

"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"

"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be
guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her
ignorance of the world,&mdash;every thing was against me. The matter itself
I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was
previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in
general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,
the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my
present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I
might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman!
she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could
not be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.
The night following this affair&mdash;I was to go the next morning&mdash;was
spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The
struggle was great, but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne,
my thorough conviction of her attachment to me&mdash;it was all
insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of
those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally
inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to
believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her,
and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence
remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I
could leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very
day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this
engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in
person, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be
dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep
to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own
magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her
miserable, and left her miserable;&mdash;and left her hoping never to see
her again."

"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor, reproachfully; "a
note would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to
call?"
[290]

[Missing Illustration: "I was formally dismissed."]

[291]
"It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the
country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the
neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between
Mrs. Smith and myself, and I resolved therefore on calling at the
cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,
was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.
You were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening
before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A
few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how
happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to
Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in
this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense
of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her
sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I
was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately&mdash;I never shall forget
it&mdash;united too with such reliance, such confidence in me! Oh, God!
what a hard-hearted rascal I was!"

They were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.

"Did you tell her that you should soon return?"

"I do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently; "less than
was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more
than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it. It won't do.
Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her
kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it did torture me. I was
miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself
for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past
sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I
went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was
only indifferent. My journey to town&mdash;travelling with my own horses,
and therefore so tediously&mdash;no creature to speak to&mdash;my own
reflections so cheerful&mdash;when I looked forward every thing so
inviting!&mdash;when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!&mdash;oh,
it was a blessed journey!"

He stopped.

"Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for
his departure, "and this is all?"[292]

"Ah!&mdash;no,&mdash;have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?
Did she show it you?"

"Yes, I saw every note that passed."

"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was
in town the whole time,) what I felt is, in the common phrase, not to
be expressed; in a more simple one&mdash;perhaps too simple to raise any
emotion, my feelings were very, very painful. Every line, every word
was&mdash;in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,
would forbid&mdash;a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town
was, in the same language, a thunderbolt. Thunderbolts and daggers!
what a reproof would she have given me! her taste, her opinions&mdash;I
believe they are better known to me than my own, and I am sure they
are dearer."

Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;&mdash;yet she felt it
her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.

"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby. Remember that you are married.
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to
hear."

"Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in
former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been
separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of
faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. I say
awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in
some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened
villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and choosing to fancy
that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of
our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,
overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be
heartily glad to hear she is well married.' But this note made me know
myself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any
other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But
every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat
was impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no
answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her
farther notice; and for some time [293]I was even determined not to call
in Berkeley Street; but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of
a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all
safely out of the house one morning, and left my name."



"Watched us out of the house!"

"Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how
often I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a
shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did
in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a
glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant
watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep
out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the
Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was
likely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in
town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of
his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's. He
asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he not
told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I
should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The
next morning brought another short note from Marianne&mdash;still
affectionate, open, artless, confiding&mdash;everything that could make
my conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried&mdash;but could
not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of
the day. If you can pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it
was then. With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced
to play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks
were worse than all. Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were
forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony
it was! Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me
Willoughby in such a tone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking
me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such
speaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on
the other hand, looking all that was&mdash;Well, it does not signify; it is
over now. Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could;
but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as death.
That was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in
which she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought
of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to
imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her
last in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I
travelled, in the same look and hue."
[294]


&quot;I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight.&quot;

[295]
A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first
rousing himself, broke it thus:

"Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,
certainly out of danger?"

"We are assured of it."

"Your poor mother, too!&mdash;doting on Marianne."

"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing
to say about that?"

"Yes, yes, that in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you
know, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting
at the Ellisons,&mdash;and her letter, with some others, was brought to me
there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia's eye before it
caught mine;&mdash;and its size, the elegance of the paper, the
hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague
report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in
Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding
evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous
than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is
delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and
read its contents. She was well paid for her impudence. She read what
made her wretched. Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her
passion&mdash;her malice&mdash;at all events it must be appeased. And, in short,
what do you think of my wife's style of
letter-writing?&mdash;delicate&mdash;tender&mdash;truly feminine&mdash;was it not?"

"Your wife! The letter was in your own hand-writing."

"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as
I was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own&mdash;her own
happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do! we were
engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed&mdash;but I am
talking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was
necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be
done to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my
character in the opinion of Marianne and[296] her friends, in what
language my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My
business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with
a bow or a bluster was of little importance. 'I am ruined for ever in
their opinion,' said I to myself; 'I am shut out for ever from their
society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter
will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were my
reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my
wife's words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three
notes&mdash;unluckily they were all in my pocket-book, or I should have
denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever&mdash;I was forced to put
them up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair&mdash;that too
I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now
searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,&mdash;the dear
lock&mdash;all, every memento was torn from me."

"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable," said Elinor,
while her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate
emotion; "you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs.
Willoughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not
forced on you. Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your
respect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have
married you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly
is no atonement to Marianne&mdash;nor can I suppose it a relief to your own
conscience."

"Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with a heavy sigh. "She does
not deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we
married. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be
happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity
me, Miss Dashwood? or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,&mdash;be
it only one degree,&mdash;am I less guilty in your opinion than I was
before? My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any
part of my guilt?"

"Yes, you have certainly removed something&mdash;a little. You have proved
yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have
proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly
know&mdash;the misery that you have inflicted&mdash;I hardly know what could
have made it worse."

"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have
been[297] telling you?&mdash;Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as
well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me
be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my
present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural,
more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my
penitence&mdash;tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if
you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever."

"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be
called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the
particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her
illness."

"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton,
and when he saw who I was, for the first time these two months&mdash;he
spoke to me. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen
without surprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured,
honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for
your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he
knew ought to, though probably he did not think it would, vex me
horridly. As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that
Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland&mdash;a letter
that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most
imminent&mdash;the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &amp;c. I was too much
shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the
undiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;
and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he
almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise
about a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was
dying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,
scorning, hating me in her latest moments&mdash;for how could I tell what
horrid projects might not have been imputed? One person I was sure
would represent me as capable of any thing. What I felt was dreadful!
My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was
in my carriage. Now you know all."

Elinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage[298] of person
and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
feeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and
vain&mdash;Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of
another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or
at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each
faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to
punishment. The attachment, from which against honour, against
feeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself,
now, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the
connection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left
her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to
himself of a far more incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind
she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who,
rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in
preparation for going, and said&mdash;

"There is no use in staying here; I must be off."

"Are you going back to town?"

"No&mdash;to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a
day or two. Good bye."

He held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;&mdash;he
pressed it with affection.

"And you do think something better of me than you did?"&mdash;said he,
letting it fall, and leaning against the mantelpiece as if forgetting
he was to go.

Elinor assured him that she did;&mdash;that she forgave, pitied, wished him
well&mdash;was even interested in his happiness&mdash;and added some gentle
counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was
not very encouraging.

"As to that," said he, "I must rub through the world as well as I can.
Domestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed
to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions,
it may be the means&mdash;it may put me on my guard&mdash;at least, it may be
something to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again&mdash;"

Elinor stopped him with a reproof.

"Well,"&mdash;he replied&mdash;"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live
in dread of one event."[299]

"What do you mean?"

"Your sister's marriage."

"You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is
now."

"But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should
be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear&mdash;but I will not
stay to rob myself of all your compassionate good-will, by showing that
where I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,&mdash;God bless
you!"

And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.




CHAPTER XLV


Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the
sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
was the general result, to think even of her sister.

Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the
most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited
a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which
made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with
a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged
within herself&mdash;to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his
influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought
not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,
that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to
possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not
even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long
before she could feel his influence less.

When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her
just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The past, the present, the future,
Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected
arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept
off every indication of[300] fatigue, and made her only fearful of
betraying herself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which
that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's
leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of
another carriage. Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary
moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and
reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as
she entered it.

Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to
inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but she, waiting
neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;
and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment
as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her
fears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter
and her friend; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable
to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at
intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at
once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in
the bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even
greater than her own.

As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was
her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,
rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther
sleep;&mdash;but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when
the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing
her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for
conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood would sit up with her all
night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to
bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours
of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by
irritation of spirits. Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now
allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would
not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now
acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly[301] before. But her
promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She
dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne
might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be
happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.
Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to
his sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the
reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.
Willoughby's death.

The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened
to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her
uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out
for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further
intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,
that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret
away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be
infection.

Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness
of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she
repeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.
Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without
sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But
Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own
disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the
exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it.
Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began
to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate
attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her; and in her
recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It
was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private
conference between them occurred.

"At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my
happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself."

Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and
not surprised, was all silent attention.

"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you
as the object most desirable. And I believe[302] Marianne will be the most
happy with him of the two."

Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their
age, characters, or feelings, could be given;&mdash;but her mother must
always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject,
and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.

"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came
out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could
talk of nothing but my child;&mdash;he could not conceal his distress; I
saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere
friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a
sympathy&mdash;or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose&mdash;giving way to
irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender,
constant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever
since the first moment of seeing her."

Here, however, Elinor perceived,&mdash;not the language, not the
professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her
mother's active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her
as it chose.

"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby
ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant,
which ever we are to call it, has subsisted through all the knowledge
of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!
and without selfishness, without encouraging a hope! could he have
seen her happy with another. Such a noble mind! such openness, such
sincerity! No one can be deceived in him."

"Colonel Brandon's character," said Elinor, "as an excellent man, is
well established."

"I know it is," replied her mother seriously, "or after such a
warning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to
be pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active,
such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of
men."

"His character, however," answered Elinor, "does not rest on one act
of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of
the case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the
Middletons, he has been long and intimately[303] known; they equally love
and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately
acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem
him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as
yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the
world. What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?"

"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.
Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or
encouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible
effusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet
after a time I did say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if
she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in
promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful
security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every
encouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will
do everything; Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a
man as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it."

"To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet made
him equally sanguine."

"No. He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change
in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again
free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a
difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,
however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as
to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles
fixed;&mdash;and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very
one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are
all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is
not so handsome as Willoughby&mdash;but at the same time, there is
something much more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a
something,&mdash;if you remember,&mdash;in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I
did not like."

Elinor could not remember it;&mdash;but her mother, without waiting for
her assent, continued&mdash;

"And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only more pleasing to
me than Willoughby's ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to
be more solidly attaching to[304] Marianne. Their gentleness, their
genuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied
simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the
liveliness&mdash;often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am
very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as
he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been
so happy with him as she will be with Colonel Brandon."

She paused. Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her
dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.

"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me," added Mrs.
Dashwood, "even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,&mdash;for I
hear it is a large village,&mdash;indeed there certainly must be some
small house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as
our present situation."

Poor Elinor!&mdash;here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!&mdash;but
her spirit was stubborn.

"His fortune too!&mdash;for at my time of life you know, everybody cares
about that;&mdash;and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it
really is, I am sure it must be a good one."

Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and
Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to
her friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.




CHAPTER XLVI


Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long
enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength,
and her mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to
enable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the
latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. When there, at her own
particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to
him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.

His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in
receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was
such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something[305] more than
his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance
between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.

Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but
with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to
very different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what
arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the
actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that
something more than gratitude already dawned.

At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her
daughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On her
measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not
quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was
soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there
as equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.
Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better
accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint
invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active
good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well
as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the
cottage, in the course of a few weeks.

The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after
taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so
earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due
to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and
bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was
carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed
anxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk
of the travellers, and feel their own[306] dullness, till Mrs. Jennings
was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid
for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon
immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.

The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey
on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous
affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her
comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found
their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To
Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She,
who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by
anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor
fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally
share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as
she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to
contentment and cheerfulness.

As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which
every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful
recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her
face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But
here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she
assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw
only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender
than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole
of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened
to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could
be connected. She said little, but every sentence aimed at
cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed
away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her
piano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first
rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some
of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name
in his hand-writing. That would not do. She shook her head, put the
music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained[307]
of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again;
declaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in
future practice much.

The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the
contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as
the only happiness worth a wish.

"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength," said
she, "we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will
walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;
and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its
foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall
be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be
later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall
divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own
library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing
beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at
the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know
I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I
shall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction
which I now feel myself to want."

Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she
remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved
to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she
appointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.
[308]


&quot;And see how the children go on.&quot;

[309]
Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a
soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's
wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's
arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in
the lane before the house.

The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in
an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;&mdash;and they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned
towards it, Marianne calmly said&mdash;

"There, exactly there,"&mdash;pointing with one hand, "on that projecting
mound,&mdash;there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby."

Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,

"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the
spot! shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?" hesitatingly it was
said. "Or will it be wrong? I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought
to do."

Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.

"As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done with that, as far as he
is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have
been for him, but what they are now. At present, if I could be
satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not
always acting a part, not always deceiving me; but above all, if I
could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have
sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl&mdash;"

She stopped. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered&mdash;

"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy."

"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it
horrible to suspect a person, who has been what he has been to me,
of such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a
situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to&mdash;"[310]

"How then," asked her sister, "would you account for his behaviour?"

"I would suppose him&mdash;Oh, how gladly would I suppose him!&mdash;only
fickle, very, very fickle."

Elinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till
Marianne were in stronger health; and they crept on for a few minutes
in silence.

"I am not wishing him too much good," said Marianne at last with a
sigh, "when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own. He will suffer enough in them."

"Do you compare your conduct with his?"

"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with
yours."

"Our situations have borne little resemblance."

"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My
illness has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I
was perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my
recovery,&mdash;wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to
have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at
once. Had I died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my
nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful
selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my
heart! How should I have lived in your remembrance! My mother too!
How could you have consoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of
myself. Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw[311] some duty
neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed injured by me.
The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid
with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the
Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and
unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper
irritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to
them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But
you, you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and
only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence
me?&mdash;not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself. Your
example was before me; but to what avail? Was I more considerate of
you and your comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your
restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general
complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left
to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than
when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion
of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me,
regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me, and
leaving you, for I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable
for my sake."

Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,
impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly
that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well
deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied&mdash;

"You are very good. The future must be my proof. I have laid down my
plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it&mdash;my feelings shall be
governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others,
nor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my
mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will
share my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I
shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do
mix in other society, it will be only to show that my spirit is
humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the
lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for
Willoughby&mdash;to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him,
would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome[312] by no change of
circumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be
checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment."

She paused&mdash;and added in a low voice, "If I could but know his
heart, everything would become easy."

Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at
all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as
reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
leading to the fact.

She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her
anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief
points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his
repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.
Marianne said not a word. She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the
ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A
thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge
one. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,
unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears
covered her cheeks.

Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they
reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her
curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked
of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was
carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where
minuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the
house, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just
articulate through her tears, "Tell mama," withdrew from her sister
and walked slowly up stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a
solitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind
anxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the
subject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the
parlour to fulfill her parting injunction.




[313]
CHAPTER XLVII


Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former
favourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his
imputed guilt;&mdash;she was sorry for him;&mdash;she wished him happy. But the
feelings of the past could not be recalled. Nothing could restore him
with a faith unbroken&mdash;a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing
could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through
his means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing
could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the
interests of Colonel Brandon.

Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from
himself,&mdash;had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence
of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion
would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in
her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed
explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection
had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of
Willoughby's deserts; she wished, therefore, to declare only the
simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his
character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray.

In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him again; but that it was not without an
effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for
some time previously sitting, her rising colour, as she spoke, and her
unsteady voice, plainly showed.

"I wish to assure you both," said she, "that I see every thing&mdash;as you
can desire me to do."

Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing
tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's
unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne
slowly continued&mdash;

"It is a great relief to me&mdash;what Elinor told me this morning&mdash;I have
now heard exactly what I wished to hear."&mdash;For some moments her voice
was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness
than before&mdash;"I am now perfectly[314] satisfied, I wish for no change. I
never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or
later I must have known, all this. I should have had no confidence, no
esteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."

"I know it&mdash;I know it," cried her mother. "Happy with a man of
libertine practices!&mdash;With one who so injured the peace of the dearest
of our friends, and the best of men!&mdash;No&mdash;my Marianne has not a heart
to be made happy with such a man!&mdash;Her conscience, her sensitive
conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband
ought to have felt."

Marianne sighed, and repeated, "I wish for no change."

"You consider the matter," said Elinor, "exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as
well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved
you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would
have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less
certain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His
expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct
declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His
demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income,
must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous
to you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before.
Your sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when
aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear
to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched
only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it,
but beyond that&mdash;and how little could the utmost of your single
management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?
beyond that, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge
his enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing
on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your
own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which
had involved him in such difficulties?"

Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word "Selfish?" in a
tone that implied, "do you really think him selfish?"

"The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor, "from the[315] beginning to
the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was
selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which
afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession
of it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment,
or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle."

"It is very true. My happiness never was his object."

"At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he has done. And why
does he regret it?&mdash;Because he finds it has not answered towards
himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now
unembarrassed&mdash;he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks
only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than
yourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have
been happy?&mdash;The inconveniences would have been different. He would
then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they
are removed, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of
whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always
necessitous&mdash;always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a
wife."

"I have not a doubt of it," said Marianne; "and I have nothing to
regret&mdash;nothing but my own folly."

"Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child," said Mrs. Dashwood;
"she must be answerable."

Marianne would not let her proceed;&mdash;and Elinor, satisfied that each
felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that
might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first
subject, immediately continued&mdash;

"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the
story&mdash;that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime
has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present
discontents."

Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led
by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not
look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.[316]

Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following
days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;
but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear
cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time
upon her health.

Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each
other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their
usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to
Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.

Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard
nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,
nothing certain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed
between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and
in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:&mdash;"We know
nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so
prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford"; which
was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,
for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.

Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and
when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his
mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary
communication&mdash;

"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married."

Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her
turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,
whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively
taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's
countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to
bestow her principal attention.

The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,
supported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather
better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the
maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so
far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just
beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.
Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor
had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.
[317]

&quot;I suppose you know, ma&#39;am, that Mr. Ferrars is
married.&quot;

[318]
"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"

"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady
too, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of
the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the
Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look
up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest
Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me,
and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss
Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,
their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had
not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but
however, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you."

"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?"

"Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since
she was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken
young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy."

"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"

"Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look
up;&mdash;he never was a gentleman much for talking."

Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself
forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.

"Was there no one else in the carriage?"

"No, ma'am, only they two."

"Do you know where they came from?"

"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy&mdash;Mrs. Ferrars told me."

"And are they going farther westward?"

"Yes, ma'am&mdash;but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and
then they'd be sure and call here."

Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than
to expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
was very confident that Edward would[319] never come near them. She
observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going
down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.

Thomas's intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to
hear more.

"Did you see them off, before you came away?"

"No, ma'am&mdash;the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any
longer; I was afraid of being late."

"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"

"Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was
always a very handsome young lady&mdash;and she seemed vastly contented."

Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.
Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as
both her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had
often had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to
go without her dinner before.

When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to
hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now
found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of
herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,
suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she
had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her
daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well
understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to
believe, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under this
persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to
her Elinor; that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged,
more immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness,
and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter
suffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and
greater fortitude.




[320]
CHAPTER XLVIII


Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
and certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had
always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his
own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of
all. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the
lurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the
intelligence.

That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be
in orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the
living, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likely
it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure
him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were
married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's. What
had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her
mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!

They would soon, she supposed, be settled at
Delaford;&mdash;Delaford,&mdash;that place in which so much conspired to give
her an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet
desired to avoid. She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house;
saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire
of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be
suspected of half her economical practices; pursuing her own interest
in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs.
Jennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward, she knew not what
she saw, nor what she wished to see. Happy or unhappy, nothing pleased
her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.

Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
particulars,&mdash;but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
tidings. Though uncertain that any one were[321] to blame, she found fault
with every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.

"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?" was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.

"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to
hear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should
not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."

This was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel
Brandon must have some information to give.

Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on
horseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopped at their gate. It
was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear
more; and she trembled in expectation of it. But&mdash;it was not Colonel
Brandon&mdash;neither his air&mdash;nor his height. Were it possible, she must
say it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted;&mdash;she
could not be mistaken,&mdash;it was Edward. She moved away and sat down.
"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us. I will be calm, I
will be mistress of myself."

In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the
mistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look
at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have
given the world to be able to speak&mdash;and to make them understand that
she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to
him;&mdash;but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their
own discretion.

Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the
appearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel
path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before
them.

His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for
Elinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if
fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of
that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be
guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him
her hand, and wished him joy.
[322]



It was Edward.


[323]

He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor's lips
had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,
she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too
late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again
and talked of the weather.

Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal
her distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole
of the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and
therefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a
strict silence.

When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
awful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who
felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a
hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.

Another pause.

Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own
voice, now said&mdash;

"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"

"At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of surprise. "No, my mother
is in town."

"I meant," said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, "to
inquire for Mrs. Edward Ferrars."

She dared not look up;&mdash;but her mother and Marianne both turned their
eyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,
after some hesitation, said,&mdash;

"Perhaps you mean&mdash;my brother&mdash;you mean Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Robert Ferrars."

"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"&mdash;was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an
accent of the utmost amazement;&mdash;and though Elinor could not speak,
even her eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He
rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not
knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice&mdash;

"Perhaps you do not know&mdash;you may not have heard that my brother is
lately married to&mdash;to the youngest&mdash;to Miss Lucy Steele."

His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment[324] by all but
Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of
such agitation as made her hardly know where she was.

"Yes," said he, "they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish."

Elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as
soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
she thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any
where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw, or
even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a
reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of
Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word,
quitted the room, and walked out towards the village, leaving the
others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his
situation, so wonderful and so sudden,&mdash;a perplexity which they had no
means of lessening but by their own conjectures.




CHAPTER XLIX


Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might
appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and
to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily
pre-determined by all;&mdash;for after experiencing the blessings of one
imprudent engagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he
had already done for more than four years, nothing less could be
expected of him in the failure of that, than the immediate
contraction of another.

His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask
Elinor to marry him;&mdash;and considering that he was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air.

How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however,
how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he
expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly[325]
told. This only need be said;&mdash;that when they all sat down to table at
four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his
lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous
profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one
of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly
joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
swell his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any
reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his
misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love; and elevated at
once to that security with another, which he must have thought of
almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with
desire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to
happiness; and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,
flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in
him before.

His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors
confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all
the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.

"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side," said he, "the
consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment. Had my
mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen
from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never
have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at
the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I
then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a
distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown
the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as
in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do,
instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to
choose any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the
first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment,
which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not
entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the
world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not
make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no
companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not
unnatural[326] for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt
myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I
spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen:
Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty
too&mdash;at least I thought so then; and I had seen so little of other
women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects.
Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement
was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at
the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly."

The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the
happiness of the Dashwoods, was such&mdash;so great&mdash;as promised them all,
the satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be
comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough,
how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his
delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained
conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and
society of both.

Marianne could speak her happiness only by tears. Comparisons would
occur&mdash;regrets would arise;&mdash;and her joy, though sincere as her love
for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor
language.

But Elinor&mdash;how are her feelings to be described? From the moment of
learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to
the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly
followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the
second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude
removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,&mdash;saw
him honourably released from his former engagement,&mdash;saw him instantly
profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection
as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,&mdash;she was
oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity; and happily disposed
as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the
better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits,
or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.

Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;&mdash;for whatever
other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a
week should be given[327] up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and
the future;&mdash;for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is
different. Between them no subject is finished, no communication is
even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.

Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;&mdash;and
Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in
every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,
and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of
whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any
admiration,&mdash;a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose
account that brother had been thrown off by his family&mdash;it was beyond
her comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful
affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her
reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.

Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,
at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so
worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all
the rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,
of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs
might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.

"That was exactly like Robert," was his immediate observation. "And
that," he presently added, "might perhaps be in his head when the
acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs
might afterward arise."

How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally
at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had
remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no
means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very
last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not
the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred[328] to prepare him
for what followed;&mdash;and when at last it burst on him in a letter from
Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified
between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He
put the letter into Elinor's hands.

"Dear Sir,

"Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have
thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and
have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to
think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand
while the heart was another's. Sincerely wish you happy in
your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not
always good friends, as our near relationship now makes
proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure
you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. Your
brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could
not live without one another, we are just returned from the
altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks,
which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,
but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines,
and shall always remain&mdash;

"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,

"Lucy Ferrars."

"I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture
the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls&mdash;but the
ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep."

Elinor read and returned it without any comment.

"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition," said Edward.
"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by you in
former days. In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife! how I have
blushed over the pages of her writing! and I believe I may say that
since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only
letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any
amends for the defect of the style."

"However it may have come about," said Elinor, after a pause,&mdash;"they
are certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert,
through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his
own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand[329]
a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for
intending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's
marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her."

"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite. She
will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him
much sooner."

In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew
not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been
attempted by him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours
after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the
nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of
conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate
connection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with
Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking that fate, it is to be
supposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of
Colonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own
deserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did
not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his
business, however, to say that he did, and he said it very prettily.
What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred
to the imagination of husbands and wives.

That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of
malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to
Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her
character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,
even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her opinions, they had been equally
imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter
reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,
good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an
engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to
his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret
to him.

"I thought it my duty," said he, "independent of my feelings, to give[330]
her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was
renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend
in the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there
seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly
insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but
the most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I
cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage
it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the
smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.
She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."

"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;
that your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost
nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it
fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was
certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration
among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it
would be better for her to marry you than be single."

Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have
been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the
motive of it.

Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence
which compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them
at Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.

"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong," said she; "because&mdash;to say
nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to
fancy and expect what, as you were then situated, could never be."

He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken
confidence in the force of his engagement.

"I was simple enough to think, that because my faith was plighted to
another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the
consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only
friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and
Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I was
wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I
reconciled myself to the[331] expediency of it, were no better than
these:&mdash;The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but
myself."

Elinor smiled, and shook her head.

Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the
Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with
him, but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer
resented his giving him the living of Delaford&mdash;"Which, at present,"
said he, "after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the
occasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering."

Now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the
place. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed
all his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the
parish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor
herself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard
it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.

One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one
difficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by
mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certain&mdash;and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two
thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all
that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.
Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year
would supply them with the comforts of life.

Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his
mother towards him; and on that he rested for the residue of their
income. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would
still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his choosing herself had
been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser
evil than his choosing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence
would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.

About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to
complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of
having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company[332]
with her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every
night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned
in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te before breakfast.

A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at
least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness
of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, to
make it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he
did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:&mdash;he knew
nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was
explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to
rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it
promoted the interest of Elinor.

It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good
opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance,
for it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles
and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other
attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters
fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.

The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every
nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting
girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she
was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by
all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford. "I do think," she
continued, "nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two
days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul
suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came
crying to me the day after, in a great fright[333] for fear of Mrs.
Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it
seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on
purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven
shillings in the world;&mdash;so I was very glad to give her five guineas
to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four
weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the
Doctor again. And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them
along with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I
cannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton,
and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him."

Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most
unfortunate of women&mdash;poor Fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibility&mdash;and he considered the existence of each, under such a
blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but
Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced
to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her
daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any
suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have
been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join
with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not
rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of
spreading misery farther in the family. He thus continued:&mdash;

"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not
surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been
received from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent
by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by
a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper
submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to
her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness
of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to
be on good terms with her children."

This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
Edward. It determined him to attempt[334] a reconciliation, though not
exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.

"A letter of proper submission!" repeated he; "would they have me beg
my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to her, and breach of
honour to me? I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble
nor penitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would
not interest. I know of no submission that is proper for me to
make."

"You may certainly ask to be forgiven," said Elinor, "because you have
offended;&mdash;and I should think you might now venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mother's anger."

He agreed that he might.

"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be
convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as
imprudent in her eyes as the first."

He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a
letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,
as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing
to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally entreat her good
offices in his favour. "And if they really do interest themselves,"
said Marianne, in her new character of candour, "in bringing about a
reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not
entirely without merit."

After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days,
the two gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately
to Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his
future home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what
improvements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a
couple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.




[335]
CHAPTER L


After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always
seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward
was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.

Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of
her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of
Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar
annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and
now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.

In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not
feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his
present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he
feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him
off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.
Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying
Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power; told him, that in Miss
Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and
enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was
only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three;
but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her
representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she
judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit; and
therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own
dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she
issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next
to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was
now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was
inevitably endowed[336] with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest
objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had
been given with Fanny.

It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected,
by Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling
excuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.

With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their
completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
church early in the autumn.

The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at
the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of
the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the
spot;&mdash;could choose papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.
Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were
chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in
their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her
husband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the
world. They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of
Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their
cows.

They were visited on their first settling by almost all their
relations and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness
which she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the
Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them
honour.

"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister," said John, as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford
House, "that would be saying too much, for certainly you have been
one of the most fortunate young[337] women in the world, as it is. But, I
confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon
brother. His property here, his place, his house,&mdash;every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,&mdash;I have not
seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in
Delaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly
the person to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be
advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as
Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may
happen; for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of
anybody else,&mdash;and it will always be in your power to set her off to
advantage, and so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance;
You understand me."

But though Mrs. Ferrars did come to see them, and always treated
them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never
insulted by her real favour and preference. That was due to the
folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by
them before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the
latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the
principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful
humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the
smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars
to his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.
[338]


&quot;Everything in such respectable condition&quot;


The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging
instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest,
however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing
every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time
and conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and
privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the
view imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to
give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but
the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two
interviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that
only, he erred; for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence
would convince her in time, another visit, another conversation, was
always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered
[339]in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another
half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means
secured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of
Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,&mdash;a subject on
which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she
soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it
became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his
brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and
very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What
immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great
happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances
to cut&mdash;and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages; and from
thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by
the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was
adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,
comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty
and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for
the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty
notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon
afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and
influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert
or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having
once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in
fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, she was in every
thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite
child. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from
Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods;
and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting
between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part,
as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy
themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived
together.

What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have
puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed
to it, might have puzzled them still[340] more. It was an arrangement,
however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing
ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a
suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either
leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;&mdash;and if
Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every
particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,
and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed
no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an
exchange.

Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well
be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely
useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their
time with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well
as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish
of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less
earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It
was now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her
daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its
constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled
at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They
each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by
general consent, was to be the reward of all.

With such a confederacy against her&mdash;with a knowledge so intimate of
his goodness&mdash;with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,
which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody
else&mdash;burst on her&mdash;what could she do?

Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to
discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her
conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no
sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily
to give her hand to another!&mdash;and that other, a man who had suffered
no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two
years before, she had considered too old to be married,&mdash;and who still
sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!

But so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion, as once she had fondly[341] flattered herself with expecting,
instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her
only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm
and sober judgment she had determined on,&mdash;she found herself at
nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties,
placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the
patroness of a village.

Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,
believed he deserved to be;&mdash;in Marianne he was consoled for every
past affliction;&mdash;her regard and her society restored his mind to
animation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found
her own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and
delight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves;
and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband,
as it had once been to Willoughby.

Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness
of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character,
as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had
he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been
happy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought
its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;&mdash;nor that he
long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with
regret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from
society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a
broken heart, must not be depended on&mdash;for he did neither. He lived to
exert, and frequently to enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of
humour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses
and dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable
degree of domestic felicity.

For Marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her
loss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in
every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of
perfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him
in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.

Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without
attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and
Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret[342] had
reached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible
for being supposed to have a lover.

Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate;&mdash;and among the
merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement
between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.

      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MR. VERNON
    
    
      Langford, Dec.
    
    
      MY DEAR BROTHER,&mdash;I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of
      profiting by your kind invitation when we last parted of spending some
      weeks with you at Churchhill, and, therefore, if quite convenient to you
      and Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I shall hope within a few days
      to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired to be acquainted
      with. My kind friends here are most affectionately urgent with me to
      prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful dispositions lead them
      too much into society for my present situation and state of mind; and I
      impatiently look forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your
      delightful retirement.
    
    
      I long to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I
      shall be very eager to secure an interest I shall soon have need for all
      my fortitude, as I am on the point of separation from my own daughter. The
      long illness of her dear father prevented my paying her that attention
      which duty and affection equally dictated, and I have too much reason to
      fear that the governess to whose care I consigned her was unequal to the
      charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of the best
      private schools in town, where I shall have an opportunity of leaving her
      myself in my way to you. I am determined, you see, not to be denied
      admittance at Churchhill. It would indeed give me most painful sensations
      to know that it were not in your power to receive me.
    
    
      Your most obliged and affectionate sister,
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      II
    
    
      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Langford.
    
    
      You were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place for
      the rest of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were
      mistaken, for I have seldom spent three months more agreeably than those
      which have just flown away. At present, nothing goes smoothly; the females
      of the family are united against me. You foretold how it would be when I
      first came to Langford, and Mainwaring is so uncommonly pleasing that I
      was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember saying to myself, as
      I drove to the house, "I like this man, pray Heaven no harm come of it!"
      But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only four
      months a widow, and to be as quiet as possible: and I have been so, my
      dear creature; I have admitted no one's attentions but Mainwaring's. I
      have avoided all general flirtation whatever; I have distinguished no
      creature besides, of all the numbers resorting hither, except Sir James
      Martin, on whom I bestowed a little notice, in order to detach him from
      Miss Mainwaring; but, if the world could know my motive THERE they would
      honour me. I have been called an unkind mother, but it was the sacred
      impulse of maternal affection, it was the advantage of my daughter that
      led me on; and if that daughter were not the greatest simpleton on earth,
      I might have been rewarded for my exertions as I ought.
    
    
      Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but Frederica, who was
      born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so violently
      against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for the
      present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him myself;
      and were he but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly should: but
      I must own myself rather romantic in that respect, and that riches only
      will not satisfy me. The event of all this is very provoking: Sir James is
      gone, Maria highly incensed, and Mrs. Mainwaring insupportably jealous; so
      jealous, in short, and so enraged against me, that, in the fury of her
      temper, I should not be surprized at her appealing to her guardian, if she
      had the liberty of addressing him: but there your husband stands my
      friend; and the kindest, most amiable action of his life was his throwing
      her off for ever on her marriage. Keep up his resentment, therefore, I
      charge you. We are now in a sad state; no house was ever more altered; the
      whole party are at war, and Mainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is
      time for me to be gone; I have therefore determined on leaving them, and
      shall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in town within this week.
      If I am as little in favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must come to me
      at 10 Wigmore street; but I hope this may not be the case, for as Mr.
      Johnson, with all his faults, is a man to whom that great word
      "respectable" is always given, and I am known to be so intimate with his
      wife, his slighting me has an awkward look.
    
    
      I take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village; for
      I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is my last
      resource. Were there another place in England open to me I would prefer
      it. Charles Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife. At
      Churchhill, however, I must remain till I have something better in view.
      My young lady accompanies me to town, where I shall deposit her under the
      care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she becomes a little more
      reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the girls are all of
      the best families. The price is immense, and much beyond what I can ever
      attempt to pay.
    
    
      Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.
    
    
      Yours ever,
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      III
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Mother,&mdash;I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in
      our power to keep our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we
      are prevented that happiness by a circumstance which is not likely to make
      us any amends. Lady Susan, in a letter to her brother-in-law, has declared
      her intention of visiting us almost immediately; and as such a visit is in
      all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is impossible to
      conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for such an event, nor
      can I now account for her ladyship's conduct; Langford appeared so exactly
      the place for her in every respect, as well from the elegant and expensive
      style of living there, as from her particular attachment to Mr.
      Mainwaring, that I was very far from expecting so speedy a distinction,
      though I always imagined from her increasing friendship for us since her
      husband's death that we should, at some future period, be obliged to
      receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great deal too kind to her when he
      was in Staffordshire; her behaviour to him, independent of her general
      character, has been so inexcusably artful and ungenerous since our
      marriage was first in agitation that no one less amiable and mild than
      himself could have overlooked it all; and though, as his brother's widow,
      and in narrow circumstances, it was proper to render her pecuniary
      assistance, I cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to her to visit
      us at Churchhill perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always is
      to think the best of everyone, her display of grief, and professions of
      regret, and general resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his
      heart and make him really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I
      am still unconvinced, and plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I
      cannot make up my mind till I better understand her real meaning in coming
      to us. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam, with what feelings I look
      forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for all those attractive
      powers for which she is celebrated to gain any share of my regard; and I
      shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against their influence, if not
      accompanied by something more substantial. She expresses a most eager
      desire of being acquainted with me, and makes very gracious mention of my
      children but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a woman who has behaved
      with inattention, if not with unkindness, to her own child, should be
      attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be placed at a school in London
      before her mother comes to us which I am glad of, for her sake and my own.
      It must be to her advantage to be separated from her mother, and a girl of
      sixteen who has received so wretched an education, could not be a very
      desirable companion here. Reginald has long wished, I know, to see the
      captivating Lady Susan, and we shall depend on his joining our party soon.
      I am glad to hear that my father continues so well; and am, with best
      love, &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON.

      MR. DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON
    
    
      Parklands.
    
    
      My dear Sister,&mdash;I congratulate you and Mr. Vernon on being about to
      receive into your family the most accomplished coquette in England. As a
      very distinguished flirt I have always been taught to consider her, but it
      has lately fallen in my way to hear some particulars of her conduct at
      Langford: which prove that she does not confine herself to that sort of
      honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires to the more
      delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable. By her
      behaviour to Mr. Mainwaring she gave jealousy and wretchedness to his
      wife, and by her attentions to a young man previously attached to Mr.
      Mainwaring's sister deprived an amiable girl of her lover.
    
    
      I learnt all this from Mr. Smith, now in this neighbourhood (I have dined
      with him, at Hurst and Wilford), who is just come from Langford where he
      was a fortnight with her ladyship, and who is therefore well qualified to
      make the communication.
    
    
      What a woman she must be! I long to see her, and shall certainly accept
      your kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those bewitching powers
      which can do so much&mdash;engaging at the same time, and in the same
      house, the affections of two men, who were neither of them at liberty to
      bestow them&mdash;and all this without the charm of youth! I am glad to
      find Miss Vernon does not accompany her mother to Churchhill, as she has
      not even manners to recommend her; and, according to Mr. Smith's account,
      is equally dull and proud. Where pride and stupidity unite there can be no
      dissimulation worthy notice, and Miss Vernon shall be consigned to
      unrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather Lady Susan possesses a
      degree of captivating deceit which it must be pleasing to witness and
      detect. I shall be with you very soon, and am ever,
    
    
      Your affectionate brother,
    
    
      R. DE COURCY. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      V
    
    
      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      I received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left town, and rejoice
      to be assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your engagement the
      evening before. It is undoubtedly better to deceive him entirely, and
      since he will be stubborn he must be tricked. I arrived here in safety,
      and have no reason to complain of my reception from Mr. Vernon; but I
      confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour of his lady. She
      is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a woman of fashion, but
      her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in
      my favour. I wanted her to be delighted at seeing me. I was as amiable as
      possible on the occasion, but all in vain. She does not like me. To be
      sure when we consider that I DID take some pains to prevent my
      brother-in-law's marrying her, this want of cordiality is not very
      surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and vindictive spirit to resent
      a project which influenced me six years ago, and which never succeeded at
      last.
    
    
      I am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy Vernon
      Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying circumstance,
      especially as the sale took place exactly at the time of his marriage; and
      everybody ought to respect the delicacy of those feelings which could not
      endure that my husband's dignity should be lessened by his younger
      brother's having possession of the family estate. Could matters have been
      so arranged as to prevent the necessity of our leaving the castle, could
      we have lived with Charles and kept him single, I should have been very
      far from persuading my husband to dispose of it elsewhere; but Charles was
      on the point of marrying Miss De Courcy, and the event has justified me.
      Here are children in abundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me
      from his purchasing Vernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given
      his wife an unfavourable impression, but where there is a disposition to
      dislike, a motive will never be wanting; and as to money matters it has
      not withheld him from being very useful to me. I really have a regard for
      him, he is so easily imposed upon! The house is a good one, the furniture
      fashionable, and everything announces plenty and elegance. Charles is very
      rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a banking-house he
      rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with it, keep very little
      company, and never go to London but on business. We shall be as stupid as
      possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law's heart through the children; I
      know all their names already, and am going to attach myself with the
      greatest sensibility to one in particular, a young Frederic, whom I take
      on my lap and sigh over for his dear uncle's sake.
    
    
      Poor Mainwaring! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how perpetually
      he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on my arrival here,
      full of complaints of his wife and sister, and lamentations on the cruelty
      of his fate. I passed off the letter as his wife's, to the Vernons, and
      when I write to him it must be under cover to you.
    
    
      Ever yours, S. VERNON.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VI
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO MR. DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      Well, my dear Reginald, I have seen this dangerous creature, and must give
      you some description of her, though I hope you will soon be able to form
      your own judgment. She is really excessively pretty; however you may
      choose to question the allurements of a lady no longer young, I must, for
      my own part, declare that I have seldom seen so lovely a woman as Lady
      Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and dark eyelashes; and
      from her appearance one would not suppose her more than five and twenty,
      though she must in fact be ten years older, I was certainly not disposed
      to admire her, though always hearing she was beautiful; but I cannot help
      feeling that she possesses an uncommon union of symmetry, brilliancy, and
      grace. Her address to me was so gentle, frank, and even affectionate,
      that, if I had not known how much she has always disliked me for marrying
      Mr. Vernon, and that we had never met before, I should have imagined her
      an attached friend. One is apt, I believe, to connect assurance of manner
      with coquetry, and to expect that an impudent address will naturally
      attend an impudent mind; at least I was myself prepared for an improper
      degree of confidence in Lady Susan; but her countenance is absolutely
      sweet, and her voice and manner winningly mild. I am sorry it is so, for
      what is this but deceit? Unfortunately, one knows her too well. She is
      clever and agreeable, has all that knowledge of the world which makes
      conversation easy, and talks very well, with a happy command of language,
      which is too often used, I believe, to make black appear white. She has
      already almost persuaded me of her being warmly attached to her daughter,
      though I have been so long convinced to the contrary. She speaks of her
      with so much tenderness and anxiety, lamenting so bitterly the neglect of
      her education, which she represents however as wholly unavoidable, that I
      am forced to recollect how many successive springs her ladyship spent in
      town, while her daughter was left in Staffordshire to the care of
      servants, or a governess very little better, to prevent my believing what
      she says.
    
    
      If her manners have so great an influence on my resentful heart, you may
      judge how much more strongly they operate on Mr. Vernon's generous temper.
      I wish I could be as well satisfied as he is, that it was really her
      choice to leave Langford for Churchhill; and if she had not stayed there
      for months before she discovered that her friend's manner of living did
      not suit her situation or feelings, I might have believed that concern for
      the loss of such a husband as Mr. Vernon, to whom her own behaviour was
      far from unexceptionable, might for a time make her wish for retirement.
      But I cannot forget the length of her visit to the Mainwarings, and when I
      reflect on the different mode of life which she led with them from that to
      which she must now submit, I can only suppose that the wish of
      establishing her reputation by following though late the path of
      propriety, occasioned her removal from a family where she must in reality
      have been particularly happy. Your friend Mr. Smith's story, however,
      cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds regularly with Mrs.
      Mainwaring. At any rate it must be exaggerated. It is scarcely possible
      that two men should be so grossly deceived by her at once.
    
    
      Yours, &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VII
    
    
      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Alicia,&mdash;You are very good in taking notice of Frederica, and
      I am grateful for it as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have
      any doubt of the warmth of your affection, I am far from exacting so heavy
      a sacrifice. She is a stupid girl, and has nothing to recommend her. I
      would not, therefore, on my account, have you encumber one moment of your
      precious time by sending for her to Edward Street, especially as every
      visit is so much deducted from the grand affair of education, which I
      really wish to have attended to while she remains at Miss Summers's. I
      want her to play and sing with some portion of taste and a good deal of
      assurance, as she has my hand and arm and a tolerable voice. I was so much
      indulged in my infant years that I was never obliged to attend to
      anything, and consequently am without the accomplishments which are now
      necessary to finish a pretty woman. Not that I am an advocate for the
      prevailing fashion of acquiring a perfect knowledge of all languages,
      arts, and sciences. It is throwing time away to be mistress of French,
      Italian, and German: music, singing, and drawing, &amp;c., will gain a
      woman some applause, but will not add one lover to her list&mdash;grace
      and manner, after all, are of the greatest importance. I do not mean,
      therefore, that Frederica's acquirements should be more than superficial,
      and I flatter myself that she will not remain long enough at school to
      understand anything thoroughly. I hope to see her the wife of Sir James
      within a twelvemonth. You know on what I ground my hope, and it is
      certainly a good foundation, for school must be very humiliating to a girl
      of Frederica's age. And, by-the-by, you had better not invite her any more
      on that account, as I wish her to find her situation as unpleasant as
      possible. I am sure of Sir James at any time, and could make him renew his
      application by a line. I shall trouble you meanwhile to prevent his
      forming any other attachment when he comes to town. Ask him to your house
      occasionally, and talk to him of Frederica, that he may not forget her.
      Upon the whole, I commend my own conduct in this affair extremely, and
      regard it as a very happy instance of circumspection and tenderness. Some
      mothers would have insisted on their daughter's accepting so good an offer
      on the first overture; but I could not reconcile it to myself to force
      Frederica into a marriage from which her heart revolted, and instead of
      adopting so harsh a measure merely propose to make it her own choice, by
      rendering her thoroughly uncomfortable till she does accept him&mdash;but
      enough of this tiresome girl. You may well wonder how I contrive to pass
      my time here, and for the first week it was insufferably dull. Now,
      however, we begin to mend, our party is enlarged by Mrs. Vernon's brother,
      a handsome young man, who promises me some amusement. There is something
      about him which rather interests me, a sort of sauciness and familiarity
      which I shall teach him to correct. He is lively, and seems clever, and
      when I have inspired him with greater respect for me than his sister's
      kind offices have implanted, he may be an agreeable flirt. There is
      exquisite pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a person
      predetermined to dislike acknowledge one's superiority. I have
      disconcerted him already by my calm reserve, and it shall be my endeavour
      to humble the pride of these self important De Courcys still lower, to
      convince Mrs. Vernon that her sisterly cautions have been bestowed in
      vain, and to persuade Reginald that she has scandalously belied me. This
      project will serve at least to amuse me, and prevent my feeling so acutely
      this dreadful separation from you and all whom I love.
    
    
      Yours ever,
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      VIII
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Mother,&mdash;You must not expect Reginald back again for some
      time. He desires me to tell you that the present open weather induces him
      to accept Mr. Vernon's invitation to prolong his stay in Sussex, that they
      may have some hunting together. He means to send for his horses
      immediately, and it is impossible to say when you may see him in Kent. I
      will not disguise my sentiments on this change from you, my dear mother,
      though I think you had better not communicate them to my father, whose
      excessive anxiety about Reginald would subject him to an alarm which might
      seriously affect his health and spirits. Lady Susan has certainly
      contrived, in the space of a fortnight, to make my brother like her. In
      short, I am persuaded that his continuing here beyond the time originally
      fixed for his return is occasioned as much by a degree of fascination
      towards her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr. Vernon, and of course I
      cannot receive that pleasure from the length of his visit which my
      brother's company would otherwise give me. I am, indeed, provoked at the
      artifice of this unprincipled woman; what stronger proof of her dangerous
      abilities can be given than this perversion of Reginald's judgment, which
      when he entered the house was so decidedly against her! In his last letter
      he actually gave me some particulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as
      he received from a gentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true,
      must raise abhorrence against her, and which Reginald himself was entirely
      disposed to credit. His opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of any
      woman in England; and when he first came it was evident that he considered
      her as one entitled neither to delicacy nor respect, and that he felt she
      would be delighted with the attentions of any man inclined to flirt with
      her. Her behaviour, I confess, has been calculated to do away with such an
      idea; I have not detected the smallest impropriety in it&mdash;nothing of
      vanity, of pretension, of levity; and she is altogether so attractive that
      I should not wonder at his being delighted with her, had he known nothing
      of her previous to this personal acquaintance; but, against reason,
      against conviction, to be so well pleased with her, as I am sure he is,
      does really astonish me. His admiration was at first very strong, but no
      more than was natural, and I did not wonder at his being much struck by
      the gentleness and delicacy of her manners; but when he has mentioned her
      of late it has been in terms of more extraordinary praise; and yesterday
      he actually said that he could not be surprised at any effect produced on
      the heart of man by such loveliness and such abilities; and when I
      lamented, in reply, the badness of her disposition, he observed that
      whatever might have been her errors they were to be imputed to her
      neglected education and early marriage, and that she was altogether a
      wonderful woman. This tendency to excuse her conduct or to forget it, in
      the warmth of admiration, vexes me; and if I did not know that Reginald is
      too much at home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening his
      visit, I should regret Mr. Vernon's giving him any. Lady Susan's
      intentions are of course those of absolute coquetry, or a desire of
      universal admiration; I cannot for a moment imagine that she has anything
      more serious in view; but it mortifies me to see a young man of Reginald's
      sense duped by her at all.
    
    
      I am, &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON.

      MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY S. VERNON
    
    
      Edward Street.
    
    
      My dearest Friend,&mdash;I congratulate you on Mr. De Courcy's arrival,
      and I advise you by all means to marry him; his father's estate is, we
      know, considerable, and I believe certainly entailed. Sir Reginald is very
      infirm, and not likely to stand in your way long. I hear the young man
      well spoken of; and though no one can really deserve you, my dearest
      Susan, Mr. De Courcy may be worth having. Mainwaring will storm of course,
      but you easily pacify him; besides, the most scrupulous point of honour
      could not require you to wait for HIS emancipation. I have seen Sir James;
      he came to town for a few days last week, and called several times in
      Edward Street. I talked to him about you and your daughter, and he is so
      far from having forgotten you, that I am sure he would marry either of you
      with pleasure. I gave him hopes of Frederica's relenting, and told him a
      great deal of her improvements. I scolded him for making love to Maria
      Mainwaring; he protested that he had been only in joke, and we both
      laughed heartily at her disappointment; and, in short, were very
      agreeable. He is as silly as ever.
    
    
      Yours faithfully,
    
    
      ALICIA. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      X
    
    
      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      I am much obliged to you, my dear Friend, for your advice respecting Mr.
      De Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of its
      expediency, though I am not quite determined on following it. I cannot
      easily resolve on anything so serious as marriage; especially as I am not
      at present in want of money, and might perhaps, till the old gentleman's
      death, be very little benefited by the match. It is true that I am vain
      enough to believe it within my reach. I have made him sensible of my
      power, and can now enjoy the pleasure of triumphing over a mind prepared
      to dislike me, and prejudiced against all my past actions. His sister,
      too, is, I hope, convinced how little the ungenerous representations of
      anyone to the disadvantage of another will avail when opposed by the
      immediate influence of intellect and manner. I see plainly that she is
      uneasy at my progress in the good opinion of her brother, and conclude
      that nothing will be wanting on her part to counteract me; but having once
      made him doubt the justice of her opinion of me, I think I may defy her.
      It has been delightful to me to watch his advances towards intimacy,
      especially to observe his altered manner in consequence of my repressing
      by the cool dignity of my deportment his insolent approach to direct
      familiarity. My conduct has been equally guarded from the first, and I
      never behaved less like a coquette in the whole course of my life, though
      perhaps my desire of dominion was never more decided. I have subdued him
      entirely by sentiment and serious conversation, and made him, I may
      venture to say, at least half in love with me, without the semblance of
      the most commonplace flirtation. Mrs. Vernon's consciousness of deserving
      every sort of revenge that it can be in my power to inflict for her
      ill-offices could alone enable her to perceive that I am actuated by any
      design in behaviour so gentle and unpretending. Let her think and act as
      she chooses, however. I have never yet found that the advice of a sister
      could prevent a young man's being in love if he chose. We are advancing
      now to some kind of confidence, and in short are likely to be engaged in a
      sort of platonic friendship. On my side you may be sure of its never being
      more, for if I were not attached to another person as much as I can be to
      anyone, I should make a point of not bestowing my affection on a man who
      had dared to think so meanly of me. Reginald has a good figure and is not
      unworthy the praise you have heard given him, but is still greatly
      inferior to our friend at Langford. He is less polished, less insinuating
      than Mainwaring, and is comparatively deficient in the power of saying
      those delightful things which put one in good humour with oneself and all
      the world. He is quite agreeable enough, however, to afford me amusement,
      and to make many of those hours pass very pleasantly which would otherwise
      be spent in endeavouring to overcome my sister-in-law's reserve, and
      listening to the insipid talk of her husband. Your account of Sir James is
      most satisfactory, and I mean to give Miss Frederica a hint of my
      intentions very soon.
    
    
      Yours, &amp;c.,
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XI
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill
    
    
      I really grow quite uneasy, my dearest mother, about Reginald, from
      witnessing the very rapid increase of Lady Susan's influence. They are now
      on terms of the most particular friendship, frequently engaged in long
      conversations together; and she has contrived by the most artful coquetry
      to subdue his judgment to her own purposes. It is impossible to see the
      intimacy between them so very soon established without some alarm, though
      I can hardly suppose that Lady Susan's plans extend to marriage. I wish
      you could get Reginald home again on any plausible pretence; he is not at
      all disposed to leave us, and I have given him as many hints of my
      father's precarious state of health as common decency will allow me to do
      in my own house. Her power over him must now be boundless, as she has
      entirely effaced all his former ill-opinion, and persuaded him not merely
      to forget but to justify her conduct. Mr. Smith's account of her
      proceedings at Langford, where he accused her of having made Mr.
      Mainwaring and a young man engaged to Miss Mainwaring distractedly in love
      with her, which Reginald firmly believed when he came here, is now, he is
      persuaded, only a scandalous invention. He has told me so with a warmth of
      manner which spoke his regret at having believed the contrary himself. How
      sincerely do I grieve that she ever entered this house! I always looked
      forward to her coming with uneasiness; but very far was it from
      originating in anxiety for Reginald. I expected a most disagreeable
      companion for myself, but could not imagine that my brother would be in
      the smallest danger of being captivated by a woman with whose principles
      he was so well acquainted, and whose character he so heartily despised. If
      you can get him away it will be a good thing.
    
    
      Yours, &amp;c.,

      SIR REGINALD DE COURCY TO HIS SON
    
    
      Parklands.
    
    
      I know that young men in general do not admit of any enquiry even from
      their nearest relations into affairs of the heart, but I hope, my dear
      Reginald, that you will be superior to such as allow nothing for a
      father's anxiety, and think themselves privileged to refuse him their
      confidence and slight his advice. You must be sensible that as an only
      son, and the representative of an ancient family, your conduct in life is
      most interesting to your connections; and in the very important concern of
      marriage especially, there is everything at stake&mdash;your own
      happiness, that of your parents, and the credit of your name. I do not
      suppose that you would deliberately form an absolute engagement of that
      nature without acquainting your mother and myself, or at least, without
      being convinced that we should approve of your choice; but I cannot help
      fearing that you may be drawn in, by the lady who has lately attached you,
      to a marriage which the whole of your family, far and near, must highly
      reprobate. Lady Susan's age is itself a material objection, but her want
      of character is one so much more serious, that the difference of even
      twelve years becomes in comparison of small amount. Were you not blinded
      by a sort of fascination, it would be ridiculous in me to repeat the
      instances of great misconduct on her side so very generally known.
    
    
      Her neglect of her husband, her encouragement of other men, her
      extravagance and dissipation, were so gross and notorious that no one
      could be ignorant of them at the time, nor can now have forgotten them. To
      our family she has always been represented in softened colours by the
      benevolence of Mr. Charles Vernon, and yet, in spite of his generous
      endeavours to excuse her, we know that she did, from the most selfish
      motives, take all possible pains to prevent his marriage with Catherine.
    
    
      My years and increasing infirmities make me very desirous of seeing you
      settled in the world. To the fortune of a wife, the goodness of my own
      will make me indifferent, but her family and character must be equally
      unexceptionable. When your choice is fixed so that no objection can be
      made to it, then I can promise you a ready and cheerful consent; but it is
      my duty to oppose a match which deep art only could render possible, and
      must in the end make wretched. It is possible her behaviour may arise only
      from vanity, or the wish of gaining the admiration of a man whom she must
      imagine to be particularly prejudiced against her; but it is more likely
      that she should aim at something further. She is poor, and may naturally
      seek an alliance which must be advantageous to herself; you know your own
      rights, and that it is out of my power to prevent your inheriting the
      family estate. My ability of distressing you during my life would be a
      species of revenge to which I could hardly stoop under any circumstances.
    
    
      I honestly tell you my sentiments and intentions: I do not wish to work on
      your fears, but on your sense and affection. It would destroy every
      comfort of my life to know that you were married to Lady Susan Vernon; it
      would be the death of that honest pride with which I have hitherto
      considered my son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think of
      him. I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by this
      letter, but I felt it my duty to tell you that your partiality for Lady
      Susan is no secret to your friends, and to warn you against her. I should
      be glad to hear your reasons for disbelieving Mr. Smith's intelligence;
      you had no doubt of its authenticity a month ago. If you can give me your
      assurance of having no design beyond enjoying the conversation of a clever
      woman for a short period, and of yielding admiration only to her beauty
      and abilities, without being blinded by them to her faults, you will
      restore me to happiness; but, if you cannot do this, explain to me, at
      least, what has occasioned so great an alteration in your opinion of her.
    
    
      I am, &amp;c., &amp;c,
    
    
      REGINALD DE COURCY

      LADY DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON
    
    
      Parklands.
    
    
      My dear Catherine,&mdash;Unluckily I was confined to my room when your
      last letter came, by a cold which affected my eyes so much as to prevent
      my reading it myself, so I could not refuse your father when he offered to
      read it to me, by which means he became acquainted, to my great vexation,
      with all your fears about your brother. I had intended to write to
      Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would let me, to point out, as well as
      I could, the danger of an intimate acquaintance, with so artful a woman as
      Lady Susan, to a young man of his age, and high expectations. I meant,
      moreover, to have reminded him of our being quite alone now, and very much
      in need of him to keep up our spirits these long winter evenings. Whether
      it would have done any good can never be settled now, but I am excessively
      vexed that Sir Reginald should know anything of a matter which we foresaw
      would make him so uneasy. He caught all your fears the moment he had read
      your letter, and I am sure he has not had the business out of his head
      since. He wrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter full of it all,
      and particularly asking an explanation of what he may have heard from Lady
      Susan to contradict the late shocking reports. His answer came this
      morning, which I shall enclose to you, as I think you will like to see it.
      I wish it was more satisfactory; but it seems written with such a
      determination to think well of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to
      marriage, &amp;c., do not set my heart at ease. I say all I can, however,
      to satisfy your father, and he is certainly less uneasy since Reginald's
      letter. How provoking it is, my dear Catherine, that this unwelcome guest
      of yours should not only prevent our meeting this Christmas, but be the
      occasion of so much vexation and trouble! Kiss the dear children for me.
    
    
      Your affectionate mother,
    
    
      C. DE COURCY. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XIV
    
    
      MR. DE COURCY TO SIR REGINALD
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Sir,&mdash;I have this moment received your letter, which has
      given me more astonishment than I ever felt before. I am to thank my
      sister, I suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure
      me in your opinion, and give you all this alarm. I know not why she should
      choose to make herself and her family uneasy by apprehending an event
      which no one but herself, I can affirm, would ever have thought possible.
      To impute such a design to Lady Susan would be taking from her every claim
      to that excellent understanding which her bitterest enemies have never
      denied her; and equally low must sink my pretensions to common sense if I
      am suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour to her. Our difference
      of age must be an insuperable objection, and I entreat you, my dear
      father, to quiet your mind, and no longer harbour a suspicion which cannot
      be more injurious to your own peace than to our understandings. I can have
      no other view in remaining with Lady Susan, than to enjoy for a short time
      (as you have yourself expressed it) the conversation of a woman of high
      intellectual powers. If Mrs. Vernon would allow something to my affection
      for herself and her husband in the length of my visit, she would do more
      justice to us all; but my sister is unhappily prejudiced beyond the hope
      of conviction against Lady Susan. From an attachment to her husband, which
      in itself does honour to both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at
      preventing their union, which have been attributed to selfishness in Lady
      Susan; but in this case, as well as in many others, the world has most
      grossly injured that lady, by supposing the worst where the motives of her
      conduct have been doubtful. Lady Susan had heard something so materially
      to the disadvantage of my sister as to persuade her that the happiness of
      Mr. Vernon, to whom she was always much attached, would be wholly
      destroyed by the marriage. And this circumstance, while it explains the
      true motives of Lady Susan's conduct, and removes all the blame which has
      been so lavished on her, may also convince us how little the general
      report of anyone ought to be credited; since no character, however
      upright, can escape the malevolence of slander. If my sister, in the
      security of retirement, with as little opportunity as inclination to do
      evil, could not avoid censure, we must not rashly condemn those who,
      living in the world and surrounded with temptations, should be accused of
      errors which they are known to have the power of committing.
    
    
      I blame myself severely for having so easily believed the slanderous tales
      invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady Susan, as I am now
      convinced how greatly they have traduced her. As to Mrs. Mainwaring's
      jealousy it was totally his own invention, and his account of her
      attaching Miss Mainwaring's lover was scarcely better founded. Sir James
      Martin had been drawn in by that young lady to pay her some attention; and
      as he is a man of fortune, it was easy to see HER views extended to
      marriage. It is well known that Miss M. is absolutely on the catch for a
      husband, and no one therefore can pity her for losing, by the superior
      attractions of another woman, the chance of being able to make a worthy
      man completely wretched. Lady Susan was far from intending such a
      conquest, and on finding how warmly Miss Mainwaring resented her lover's
      defection, determined, in spite of Mr. and Mrs. Mainwaring's most urgent
      entreaties, to leave the family. I have reason to imagine she did receive
      serious proposals from Sir James, but her removing to Langford immediately
      on the discovery of his attachment, must acquit her on that article with
      any mind of common candour. You will, I am sure, my dear Sir, feel the
      truth of this, and will hereby learn to do justice to the character of a
      very injured woman. I know that Lady Susan in coming to Churchhill was
      governed only by the most honourable and amiable intentions; her prudence
      and economy are exemplary, her regard for Mr. Vernon equal even to HIS
      deserts; and her wish of obtaining my sister's good opinion merits a
      better return than it has received. As a mother she is unexceptionable;
      her solid affection for her child is shown by placing her in hands where
      her education will be properly attended to; but because she has not the
      blind and weak partiality of most mothers, she is accused of wanting
      maternal tenderness. Every person of sense, however, will know how to
      value and commend her well-directed affection, and will join me in wishing
      that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy than she has yet done of her
      mother's tender care. I have now, my dear father, written my real
      sentiments of Lady Susan; you will know from this letter how highly I
      admire her abilities, and esteem her character; but if you are not equally
      convinced by my full and solemn assurance that your fears have been most
      idly created, you will deeply mortify and distress me.
    
    
      I am, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
    
    
      R. DE COURCY. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XV
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill
    
    
      My dear Mother,&mdash;I return you Reginald's letter, and rejoice with all
      my heart that my father is made easy by it: tell him so, with my
      congratulations; but, between ourselves, I must own it has only convinced
      ME of my brother's having no PRESENT intention of marrying Lady Susan, not
      that he is in no danger of doing so three months hence. He gives a very
      plausible account of her behaviour at Langford; I wish it may be true, but
      his intelligence must come from herself, and I am less disposed to believe
      it than to lament the degree of intimacy subsisting between them, implied
      by the discussion of such a subject. I am sorry to have incurred his
      displeasure, but can expect nothing better while he is so very eager in
      Lady Susan's justification. He is very severe against me indeed, and yet I
      hope I have not been hasty in my judgment of her. Poor woman! though I
      have reasons enough for my dislike, I cannot help pitying her at present,
      as she is in real distress, and with too much cause. She had this morning
      a letter from the lady with whom she has placed her daughter, to request
      that Miss Vernon might be immediately removed, as she had been detected in
      an attempt to run away. Why, or whither she intended to go, does not
      appear; but, as her situation seems to have been unexceptionable, it is a
      sad thing, and of course highly distressing to Lady Susan. Frederica must
      be as much as sixteen, and ought to know better; but from what her mother
      insinuates, I am afraid she is a perverse girl. She has been sadly
      neglected, however, and her mother ought to remember it. Mr. Vernon set
      off for London as soon as she had determined what should be done. He is,
      if possible, to prevail on Miss Summers to let Frederica continue with
      her; and if he cannot succeed, to bring her to Churchhill for the present,
      till some other situation can be found for her. Her ladyship is comforting
      herself meanwhile by strolling along the shrubbery with Reginald, calling
      forth all his tender feelings, I suppose, on this distressing occasion.
      She has been talking a great deal about it to me. She talks vastly well; I
      am afraid of being ungenerous, or I should say, TOO well to feel so very
      deeply; but I will not look for her faults; she may be Reginald's wife!
      Heaven forbid it! but why should I be quicker-sighted than anyone else?
      Mr. Vernon declares that he never saw deeper distress than hers, on the
      receipt of the letter; and is his judgment inferior to mine? She was very
      unwilling that Frederica should be allowed to come to Churchhill, and
      justly enough, as it seems a sort of reward to behaviour deserving very
      differently; but it was impossible to take her anywhere else, and she is
      not to remain here long. "It will be absolutely necessary," said she, "as
      you, my dear sister, must be sensible, to treat my daughter with some
      severity while she is here; a most painful necessity, but I will ENDEAVOUR
      to submit to it. I am afraid I have often been too indulgent, but my poor
      Frederica's temper could never bear opposition well: you must support and
      encourage me; you must urge the necessity of reproof if you see me too
      lenient." All this sounds very reasonable. Reginald is so incensed against
      the poor silly girl. Surely it is not to Lady Susan's credit that he
      should be so bitter against her daughter; his idea of her must be drawn
      from the mother's description. Well, whatever may be his fate, we have the
      comfort of knowing that we have done our utmost to save him. We must
      commit the event to a higher power.
    
    
      Yours ever, &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XVI
    
    
      LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      Never, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a letter this
      morning from Miss Summers. That horrid girl of mine has been trying to run
      away. I had not a notion of her being such a little devil before, she
      seemed to have all the Vernon milkiness; but on receiving the letter in
      which I declared my intention about Sir James, she actually attempted to
      elope; at least, I cannot otherwise account for her doing it. She meant, I
      suppose, to go to the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no other
      acquaintances. But she shall be punished, she shall have him. I have sent
      Charles to town to make matters up if he can, for I do not by any means
      want her here. If Miss Summers will not keep her, you must find me out
      another school, unless we can get her married immediately. Miss S. writes
      word that she could not get the young lady to assign any cause for her
      extraordinary conduct, which confirms me in my own previous explanation of
      it. Frederica is too shy, I think, and too much in awe of me to tell
      tales, but if the mildness of her uncle should get anything out of her, I
      am not afraid. I trust I shall be able to make my story as good as hers.
      If I am vain of anything, it is of my eloquence. Consideration and esteem
      as surely follow command of language as admiration waits on beauty, and
      here I have opportunity enough for the exercise of my talent, as the chief
      of my time is spent in conversation.
    
    
      Reginald is never easy unless we are by ourselves, and when the weather is
      tolerable, we pace the shrubbery for hours together. I like him on the
      whole very well; he is clever and has a good deal to say, but he is
      sometimes impertinent and troublesome. There is a sort of ridiculous
      delicacy about him which requires the fullest explanation of whatever he
      may have heard to my disadvantage, and is never satisfied till he thinks
      he has ascertained the beginning and end of everything. This is one sort
      of love, but I confess it does not particularly recommend itself to me. I
      infinitely prefer the tender and liberal spirit of Mainwaring, which,
      impressed with the deepest conviction of my merit, is satisfied that
      whatever I do must be right; and look with a degree of contempt on the
      inquisitive and doubtful fancies of that heart which seems always debating
      on the reasonableness of its emotions. Mainwaring is indeed, beyond all
      compare, superior to Reginald&mdash;superior in everything but the power
      of being with me! Poor fellow! he is much distracted by jealousy, which I
      am not sorry for, as I know no better support of love. He has been teazing
      me to allow of his coming into this country, and lodging somewhere near
      INCOG.; but I forbade everything of the kind. Those women are inexcusable
      who forget what is due to themselves, and the opinion of the world.
    
    
      Yours ever, S. VERNON.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XVII
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Mother,&mdash;Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his
      niece with him. Lady Susan had received a line from him by that day's
      post, informing her that Miss Summers had absolutely refused to allow of
      Miss Vernon's continuance in her academy; we were therefore prepared for
      her arrival, and expected them impatiently the whole evening. They came
      while we were at tea, and I never saw any creature look so frightened as
      Frederica when she entered the room. Lady Susan, who had been shedding
      tears before, and showing great agitation at the idea of the meeting,
      received her with perfect self-command, and without betraying the least
      tenderness of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, and on Frederica's bursting
      into tears as soon as we were seated, took her out of the room, and did
      not return for some time. When she did, her eyes looked very red and she
      was as much agitated as before. We saw no more of her daughter. Poor
      Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his fair friend in such
      distress, and watched her with so much tender solicitude, that I, who
      occasionally caught her observing his countenance with exultation, was
      quite out of patience. This pathetic representation lasted the whole
      evening, and so ostentatious and artful a display has entirely convinced
      me that she did in fact feel nothing. I am more angry with her than ever
      since I have seen her daughter; the poor girl looks so unhappy that my
      heart aches for her. Lady Susan is surely too severe, for Frederica does
      not seem to have the sort of temper to make severity necessary. She looks
      perfectly timid, dejected, and penitent. She is very pretty, though not so
      handsome as her mother, nor at all like her. Her complexion is delicate,
      but neither so fair nor so blooming as Lady Susan's, and she has quite the
      Vernon cast of countenance, the oval face and mild dark eyes, and there is
      peculiar sweetness in her look when she speaks either to her uncle or me,
      for as we behave kindly to her we have of course engaged her gratitude.
    
    
      Her mother has insinuated that her temper is intractable, but I never saw
      a face less indicative of any evil disposition than hers; and from what I
      can see of the behaviour of each to the other, the invariable severity of
      Lady Susan and the silent dejection of Frederica, I am led to believe as
      heretofore that the former has no real love for her daughter, and has
      never done her justice or treated her affectionately. I have not been able
      to have any conversation with my niece; she is shy, and I think I can see
      that some pains are taken to prevent her being much with me. Nothing
      satisfactory transpires as to her reason for running away. Her
      kind-hearted uncle, you may be sure, was too fearful of distressing her to
      ask many questions as they travelled. I wish it had been possible for me
      to fetch her instead of him. I think I should have discovered the truth in
      the course of a thirty-mile journey. The small pianoforte has been removed
      within these few days, at Lady Susan's request, into her dressing-room,
      and Frederica spends great part of the day there, practising as it is
      called; but I seldom hear any noise when I pass that way; what she does
      with herself there I do not know. There are plenty of books, but it is not
      every girl who has been running wild the first fifteen years of her life,
      that can or will read. Poor creature! the prospect from her window is not
      very instructive, for that room overlooks the lawn, you know, with the
      shrubbery on one side, where she may see her mother walking for an hour
      together in earnest conversation with Reginald. A girl of Frederica's age
      must be childish indeed, if such things do not strike her. Is it not
      inexcusable to give such an example to a daughter? Yet Reginald still
      thinks Lady Susan the best of mothers, and still condemns Frederica as a
      worthless girl! He is convinced that her attempt to run away proceeded
      from no, justifiable cause, and had no provocation. I am sure I cannot say
      that it HAD, but while Miss Summers declares that Miss Vernon showed no
      signs of obstinacy or perverseness during her whole stay in Wigmore
      Street, till she was detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily credit
      what Lady Susan has made him, and wants to make me believe, that it was
      merely an impatience of restraint and a desire of escaping from the
      tuition of masters which brought on the plan of an elopement. O Reginald,
      how is your judgment enslaved! He scarcely dares even allow her to be
      handsome, and when I speak of her beauty, replies only that her eyes have
      no brilliancy! Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in understanding, and
      at others that her temper only is in fault. In short, when a person is
      always to deceive, it is impossible to be consistent. Lady Susan finds it
      necessary that Frederica should be to blame, and probably has sometimes
      judged it expedient to excuse her of ill-nature and sometimes to lament
      her want of sense. Reginald is only repeating after her ladyship.
    
    
      I remain, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON.

      FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      My dear Mother,&mdash;I am very glad to find that my description of
      Frederica Vernon has interested you, for I do believe her truly deserving
      of your regard; and when I have communicated a notion which has recently
      struck me, your kind impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be
      heightened. I cannot help fancying that she is growing partial to my
      brother. I so very often see her eyes fixed on his face with a remarkable
      expression of pensive admiration. He is certainly very handsome; and yet
      more, there is an openness in his manner that must be highly
      prepossessing, and I am sure she feels it so. Thoughtful and pensive in
      general, her countenance always brightens into a smile when Reginald says
      anything amusing; and, let the subject be ever so serious that he may be
      conversing on, I am much mistaken if a syllable of his uttering escapes
      her. I want to make him sensible of all this, for we know the power of
      gratitude on such a heart as his; and could Frederica's artless affection
      detach him from her mother, we might bless the day which brought her to
      Churchhill. I think, my dear mother, you would not disapprove of her as a
      daughter. She is extremely young, to be sure, has had a wretched
      education, and a dreadful example of levity in her mother; but yet I can
      pronounce her disposition to be excellent, and her natural abilities very
      good. Though totally without accomplishments, she is by no means so
      ignorant as one might expect to find her, being fond of books and spending
      the chief of her time in reading. Her mother leaves her more to herself
      than she did, and I have her with me as much as possible, and have taken
      great pains to overcome her timidity. We are very good friends, and though
      she never opens her lips before her mother, she talks enough when alone
      with me to make it clear that, if properly treated by Lady Susan, she
      would always appear to much greater advantage. There cannot be a more
      gentle, affectionate heart; or more obliging manners, when acting without
      restraint; and her little cousins are all very fond of her.
    
    
      Your affectionate daughter,

      LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      You will be eager, I know, to hear something further of Frederica, and
      perhaps may think me negligent for not writing before. She arrived with
      her uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in
      demanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found myself to have been
      perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The prospect of it
      frightened her so thoroughly, that, with a mixture of true girlish
      perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting out of the house and
      proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had
      really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when she was
      fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the first
      distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we consider that
      it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall have room for the
      most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively
      provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss Summers
      from keeping the girl; and it seems so extraordinary a piece of nicety,
      considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only suppose the
      lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money. Be that as it
      may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and, having nothing else
      to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of romance begun at Langford.
      She is actually falling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her
      mother by refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections
      must also be given without her mother's approbation. I never saw a girl of
      her age bid fairer to be the sport of mankind. Her feelings are tolerably
      acute, and she is so charmingly artless in their display as to afford the
      most reasonable hope of her being ridiculous, and despised by every man
      who sees her.
    
    
      Artlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a
      simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet certain
      that Reginald sees what she is about, nor is it of much consequence. She
      is now an object of indifference to him, and she would be one of contempt
      were he to understand her emotions. Her beauty is much admired by the
      Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in high favour with her aunt
      altogether, because she is so little like myself, of course. She is
      exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly loves to be firm, and to
      have all the sense and all the wit of the conversation to herself:
      Frederica will never eclipse her. When she first came I was at some pains
      to prevent her seeing much of her aunt; but I have relaxed, as I believe I
      may depend on her observing the rules I have laid down for their
      discourse. But do not imagine that with all this lenity I have for a
      moment given up my plan of her marriage. No; I am unalterably fixed on
      this point, though I have not yet quite decided on the manner of bringing
      it about. I should not chuse to have the business brought on here, and
      canvassed by the wise heads of Mr. and Mrs. Vernon; and I cannot just now
      afford to go to town. Miss Frederica must therefore wait a little.
    
    
      Yours ever,
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XX
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill
    
    
      We have a very unexpected guest with us at present, my dear Mother: he
      arrived yesterday. I heard a carriage at the door, as I was sitting with
      my children while they dined; and supposing I should be wanted, left the
      nursery soon afterwards, and was half-way downstairs, when Frederica, as
      pale as ashes, came running up, and rushed by me into her own room. I
      instantly followed, and asked her what was the matter. "Oh!" said she, "he
      is come&mdash;Sir James is come, and what shall I do?" This was no
      explanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At that moment we
      were interrupted by a knock at the door: it was Reginald, who came, by
      Lady Susan's direction, to call Frederica down. "It is Mr. De Courcy!"
      said she, colouring violently. "Mamma has sent for me; I must go." We all
      three went down together; and I saw my brother examining the terrified
      face of Frederica with surprize. In the breakfast-room we found Lady
      Susan, and a young man of gentlemanlike appearance, whom she introduced by
      the name of Sir James Martin&mdash;the very person, as you may remember,
      whom it was said she had been at pains to detach from Miss Mainwaring; but
      the conquest, it seems, was not designed for herself, or she has since
      transferred it to her daughter; for Sir James is now desperately in love
      with Frederica, and with full encouragement from mamma. The poor girl,
      however, I am sure, dislikes him; and though his person and address are
      very well, he appears, both to Mr. Vernon and me, a very weak young man.
      Frederica looked so shy, so confused, when we entered the room, that I
      felt for her exceedingly. Lady Susan behaved with great attention to her
      visitor; and yet I thought I could perceive that she had no particular
      pleasure in seeing him. Sir James talked a great deal, and made many civil
      excuses to me for the liberty he had taken in coming to Churchhill&mdash;mixing
      more frequent laughter with his discourse than the subject required&mdash;said
      many things over and over again, and told Lady Susan three times that he
      had seen Mrs. Johnson a few evenings before. He now and then addressed
      Frederica, but more frequently her mother. The poor girl sat all this time
      without opening her lips&mdash;her eyes cast down, and her colour varying
      every instant; while Reginald observed all that passed in perfect silence.
      At length Lady Susan, weary, I believe, of her situation, proposed
      walking; and we left the two gentlemen together, to put on our pelisses.
      As we went upstairs Lady Susan begged permission to attend me for a few
      moments in my dressing-room, as she was anxious to speak with me in
      private. I led her thither accordingly, and as soon as the door was
      closed, she said: "I was never more surprized in my life than by Sir
      James's arrival, and the suddenness of it requires some apology to you, my
      dear sister; though to ME, as a mother, it is highly flattering. He is so
      extremely attached to my daughter that he could not exist longer without
      seeing her. Sir James is a young man of an amiable disposition and
      excellent character; a little too much of the rattle, perhaps, but a year
      or two will rectify THAT: and he is in other respects so very eligible a
      match for Frederica, that I have always observed his attachment with the
      greatest pleasure; and am persuaded that you and my brother will give the
      alliance your hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the
      likelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst
      Frederica continued at school it had better not be known to exist; but
      now, as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to school
      confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union with Sir
      James as not very distant, I had intended within a few days to acquaint
      yourself and Mr. Vernon with the whole business. I am sure, my dear
      sister, you will excuse my remaining silent so long, and agree with me
      that such circumstances, while they continue from any cause in suspense,
      cannot be too cautiously concealed. When you have the happiness of
      bestowing your sweet little Catherine, some years hence, on a man who in
      connection and character is alike unexceptionable, you will know what I
      feel now; though, thank Heaven, you cannot have all my reasons for
      rejoicing in such an event. Catherine will be amply provided for, and not,
      like my Frederica, indebted to a fortunate establishment for the comforts
      of life." She concluded by demanding my congratulations. I gave them
      somewhat awkwardly, I believe; for, in fact, the sudden disclosure of so
      important a matter took from me the power of speaking with any clearness.
      She thanked me, however, most affectionately, for my kind concern in the
      welfare of herself and daughter; and then said: "I am not apt to deal in
      professions, my dear Mrs. Vernon, and I never had the convenient talent of
      affecting sensations foreign to my heart; and therefore I trust you will
      believe me when I declare, that much as I had heard in your praise before
      I knew you, I had no idea that I should ever love you as I now do; and I
      must further say that your friendship towards me is more particularly
      gratifying because I have reason to believe that some attempts were made
      to prejudice you against me. I only wish that they, whoever they are, to
      whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the terms on which
      we now are together, and understand the real affection we feel for each
      other; but I will not detain you any longer. God bless you, for your
      goodness to me and my girl, and continue to you all your present
      happiness." What can one say of such a woman, my dear mother? Such
      earnestness such solemnity of expression! and yet I cannot help suspecting
      the truth of everything she says. As for Reginald, I believe he does not
      know what to make of the matter. When Sir James came, he appeared all
      astonishment and perplexity; the folly of the young man and the confusion
      of Frederica entirely engrossed him; and though a little private discourse
      with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he is still hurt, I am sure, at
      her allowing of such a man's attentions to her daughter. Sir James invited
      himself with great composure to remain here a few days&mdash;hoped we
      would not think it odd, was aware of its being very impertinent, but he
      took the liberty of a relation; and concluded by wishing, with a laugh,
      that he might be really one very soon. Even Lady Susan seemed a little
      disconcerted by this forwardness; in her heart I am persuaded she
      sincerely wished him gone. But something must be done for this poor girl,
      if her feelings are such as both I and her uncle believe them to be. She
      must not be sacrificed to policy or ambition, and she must not be left to
      suffer from the dread of it. The girl whose heart can distinguish Reginald
      De Courcy, deserves, however he may slight her, a better fate than to be
      Sir James Martin's wife. As soon as I can get her alone, I will discover
      the real truth; but she seems to wish to avoid me. I hope this does not
      proceed from anything wrong, and that I shall not find out I have thought
      too well of her. Her behaviour to Sir James certainly speaks the greatest
      consciousness and embarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like
      encouragement. Adieu, my dear mother.
    
    
      Yours, &amp;c.,

      XXI
    
    
      MISS VERNON TO MR DE COURCY
    
    
      Sir,&mdash;I hope you will excuse this liberty; I am forced upon it by the
      greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very
      miserable about Sir James Martin, and have no other way in the world of
      helping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden even speaking to
      my uncle and aunt on the subject; and this being the case, I am afraid my
      applying to you will appear no better than equivocation, and as if I
      attended to the letter and not the spirit of mamma's commands. But if you
      do not take my part and persuade her to break it off, I shall be half
      distracted, for I cannot bear him. No human being but YOU could have any
      chance of prevailing with her. If you will, therefore, have the
      unspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading her
      to send Sir James away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is possible
      for me to express. I always disliked him from the first: it is not a
      sudden fancy, I assure you, sir; I always thought him silly and
      impertinent and disagreeable, and now he is grown worse than ever. I would
      rather work for my bread than marry him. I do not know how to apologize
      enough for this letter; I know it is taking so great a liberty. I am aware
      how dreadfully angry it will make mamma, but I remember the risk.
    
    
      I am, Sir, your most humble servant,
    
    
      F. S. V. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XXII
    
    
      LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      This is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before,
      and must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into all
      my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin! Guess my
      astonishment, and vexation&mdash;for, as you well know, I never wished him
      to be seen at Churchhill. What a pity that you should not have known his
      intentions! Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to remain
      here a few days. I could have poisoned him! I made the best of it,
      however, and told my story with great success to Mrs. Vernon, who,
      whatever might be her real sentiments, said nothing in opposition to mine.
      I made a point also of Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James, and gave
      her to understand that I was absolutely determined on her marrying him.
      She said something of her misery, but that was all. I have for some time
      been more particularly resolved on the match from seeing the rapid
      increase of her affection for Reginald, and from not feeling secure that a
      knowledge of such affection might not in the end awaken a return.
      Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion must make them both in
      my eyes, I felt by no means assured that such might not be the
      consequence. It is true that Reginald had not in any degree grown cool
      towards me; but yet he has lately mentioned Frederica spontaneously and
      unnecessarily, and once said something in praise of her person. HE was all
      astonishment at the appearance of my visitor, and at first observed Sir
      James with an attention which I was pleased to see not unmixed with
      jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for me really to torment him, as
      Sir James, though extremely gallant to me, very soon made the whole party
      understand that his heart was devoted to my daughter. I had no great
      difficulty in convincing De Courcy, when we were alone, that I was
      perfectly justified, all things considered, in desiring the match; and the
      whole business seemed most comfortably arranged. They could none of them
      help perceiving that Sir James was no Solomon; but I had positively
      forbidden Frederica complaining to Charles Vernon or his wife, and they
      had therefore no pretence for interference; though my impertinent sister,
      I believe, wanted only opportunity for doing so. Everything, however, was
      going on calmly and quietly; and, though I counted the hours of Sir
      James's stay, my mind was entirely satisfied with the posture of affairs.
      Guess, then, what I must feel at the sudden disturbance of all my schemes;
      and that, too, from a quarter where I had least reason to expect it.
      Reginald came this morning into my dressing-room with a very unusual
      solemnity of countenance, and after some preface informed me in so many
      words that he wished to reason with me on the impropriety and unkindness
      of allowing Sir James Martin to address my daughter contrary to her
      inclinations. I was all amazement. When I found that he was not to be
      laughed out of his design, I calmly begged an explanation, and desired to
      know by what he was impelled, and by whom commissioned, to reprimand me.
      He then told me, mixing in his speech a few insolent compliments and
      ill-timed expressions of tenderness, to which I listened with perfect
      indifference, that my daughter had acquainted him with some circumstances
      concerning herself, Sir James, and me which had given him great
      uneasiness. In short, I found that she had in the first place actually
      written to him to request his interference, and that, on receiving her
      letter, he had conversed with her on the subject of it, in order to
      understand the particulars, and to assure himself of her real wishes. I
      have not a doubt but that the girl took this opportunity of making
      downright love to him. I am convinced of it by the manner in which he
      spoke of her. Much good may such love do him! I shall ever despise the man
      who can be gratified by the passion which he never wished to inspire, nor
      solicited the avowal of. I shall always detest them both. He can have no
      true regard for me, or he would not have listened to her; and SHE, with
      her little rebellious heart and indelicate feelings, to throw herself into
      the protection of a young man with whom she has scarcely ever exchanged
      two words before! I am equally confounded at HER impudence and HIS
      credulity. How dared he believe what she told him in my disfavour! Ought
      he not to have felt assured that I must have unanswerable motives for all
      that I had done? Where was his reliance on my sense and goodness then?
      Where the resentment which true love would have dictated against the
      person defaming me&mdash;that person, too, a chit, a child, without talent
      or education, whom he had been always taught to despise? I was calm for
      some time; but the greatest degree of forbearance may be overcome, and I
      hope I was afterwards sufficiently keen. He endeavoured, long endeavoured,
      to soften my resentment; but that woman is a fool indeed who, while
      insulted by accusation, can be worked on by compliments. At length he left
      me, as deeply provoked as myself; and he showed his anger more. I was
      quite cool, but he gave way to the most violent indignation; I may
      therefore expect it will the sooner subside, and perhaps his may be
      vanished for ever, while mine will be found still fresh and implacable. He
      is now shut up in his apartment, whither I heard him go on leaving mine.
      How unpleasant, one would think, must be his reflections! but some
      people's feelings are incomprehensible. I have not yet tranquillised
      myself enough to see Frederica. SHE shall not soon forget the occurrences
      of this day; she shall find that she has poured forth her tender tale of
      love in vain, and exposed herself for ever to the contempt of the whole
      world, and the severest resentment of her injured mother.

      XXIII
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      Let me congratulate you, my dearest Mother! The affair which has given us
      so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our prospect is most
      delightful, and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn, I am
      quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; for the pleasure
      of learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased by all
      that you have previously suffered. I am so much agitated by delight that I
      can scarcely hold a pen; but am determined to send you a few short lines
      by James, that you may have some explanation of what must so greatly
      astonish you, as that Reginald should be returning to Parklands. I was
      sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in the breakfast parlour,
      when my brother called me out of the room. I instantly saw that something
      was the matter; his complexion was raised, and he spoke with great
      emotion; you know his eager manner, my dear mother, when his mind is
      interested. "Catherine," said he, "I am going home to-day; I am sorry to
      leave you, but I must go: it is a great while since I have seen my father
      and mother. I am going to send James forward with my hunters immediately;
      if you have any letter, therefore, he can take it. I shall not be at home
      myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I
      have business; but before I leave you," he continued, speaking in a lower
      tone, and with still greater energy, "I must warn you of one thing&mdash;do
      not let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin. He wants to marry
      her; her mother promotes the match, but she cannot endure the idea of it.
      Be assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the truth of what I
      say; I know that Frederica is made wretched by Sir James's continuing
      here. She is a sweet girl, and deserves a better fate. Send him away
      immediately; he is only a fool: but what her mother can mean, Heaven only
      knows! Good bye," he added, shaking my hand with earnestness; "I do not
      know when you will see me again; but remember what I tell you of
      Frederica; you MUST make it your business to see justice done her. She is
      an amiable girl, and has a very superior mind to what we have given her
      credit for." He then left me, and ran upstairs. I would not try to stop
      him, for I know what his feelings must be. The nature of mine, as I
      listened to him, I need not attempt to describe; for a minute or two I
      remained in the same spot, overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort
      indeed; yet it required some consideration to be tranquilly happy. In
      about ten minutes after my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the
      room. I concluded, of course, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling;
      and looked with anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her
      face. Mistress of deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and
      after chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, "I
      find from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy&mdash;is it true
      that he leaves Churchhill this morning?" I replied that it was. "He told
      us nothing of all this last night," said she, laughing, "or even this
      morning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men
      are often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in forming than
      unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to change
      his mind at last, and not go." She soon afterwards left the room. I trust,
      however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear an alteration of
      his present plan; things have gone too far. They must have quarrelled, and
      about Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me. What delight will be
      yours in seeing him again; in seeing him still worthy your esteem, still
      capable of forming your happiness! When I next write I shall be able to
      tell you that Sir James is gone, Lady Susan vanquished, and Frederica at
      peace. We have much to do, but it shall be done. I am all impatience to
      hear how this astonishing change was effected. I finish as I began, with
      the warmest congratulations.
    
    
      Yours ever, &amp;c.,

      Little did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter, that
      the delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo so
      speedy, so melancholy a reverse. I never can sufficiently regret that I
      wrote to you at all. Yet who could have foreseen what has happened? My
      dear mother, every hope which made me so happy only two hours ago has
      vanished. The quarrel between Lady Susan and Reginald is made up, and we
      are all as we were before. One point only is gained. Sir James Martin is
      dismissed. What are we now to look forward to? I am indeed disappointed;
      Reginald was all but gone, his horse was ordered and all but brought to
      the door; who would not have felt safe? For half an hour I was in
      momentary expectation of his departure. After I had sent off my letter to
      you, I went to Mr. Vernon, and sat with him in his room talking over the
      whole matter, and then determined to look for Frederica, whom I had not
      seen since breakfast. I met her on the stairs, and saw that she was
      crying. "My dear aunt," said she, "he is going&mdash;Mr. De Courcy is
      going, and it is all my fault. I am afraid you will be very angry with me,
      but indeed I had no idea it would end so." "My love," I replied, "do not
      think it necessary to apologize to me on that account. I shall feel myself
      under an obligation to anyone who is the means of sending my brother home,
      because," recollecting myself, "I know my father wants very much to see
      him. But what is it you have done to occasion all this?" She blushed
      deeply as she answered: "I was so unhappy about Sir James that I could not
      help&mdash;I have done something very wrong, I know; but you have not an
      idea of the misery I have been in: and mamma had ordered me never to speak
      to you or my uncle about it, and&mdash;" "You therefore spoke to my
      brother to engage his interference," said I, to save her the explanation.
      "No, but I wrote to him&mdash;I did indeed, I got up this morning before
      it was light, and was two hours about it; and when my letter was done I
      thought I never should have courage to give it. After breakfast however,
      as I was going to my room, I met him in the passage, and then, as I knew
      that everything must depend on that moment, I forced myself to give it. He
      was so good as to take it immediately. I dared not look at him, and ran
      away directly. I was in such a fright I could hardly breathe. My dear
      aunt, you do not know how miserable I have been." "Frederica" said I, "you
      ought to have told me all your distresses. You would have found in me a
      friend always ready to assist you. Do you think that your uncle or I
      should not have espoused your cause as warmly as my brother?" "Indeed, I
      did not doubt your kindness," said she, colouring again, "but I thought
      Mr. De Courcy could do anything with my mother; but I was mistaken: they
      have had a dreadful quarrel about it, and he is going away. Mamma will
      never forgive me, and I shall be worse off than ever." "No, you shall
      not," I replied; "in such a point as this your mother's prohibition ought
      not to have prevented your speaking to me on the subject. She has no right
      to make you unhappy, and she shall NOT do it. Your applying, however, to
      Reginald can be productive only of good to all parties. I believe it is
      best as it is. Depend upon it that you shall not be made unhappy any
      longer." At that moment how great was my astonishment at seeing Reginald
      come out of Lady Susan's dressing-room. My heart misgave me instantly. His
      confusion at seeing me was very evident. Frederica immediately
      disappeared. "Are you going?" I said; "you will find Mr. Vernon in his own
      room." "No, Catherine," he replied, "I am not going. Will you let me speak
      to you a moment?" We went into my room. "I find," he continued, his
      confusion increasing as he spoke, "that I have been acting with my usual
      foolish impetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, and was on
      the point of leaving the house under a false impression of her conduct.
      There has been some very great mistake; we have been all mistaken, I
      fancy. Frederica does not know her mother. Lady Susan means nothing but
      her good, but she will not make a friend of her. Lady Susan does not
      always know, therefore, what will make her daughter happy. Besides, I
      could have no right to interfere. Miss Vernon was mistaken in applying to
      me. In short, Catherine, everything has gone wrong, but it is now all
      happily settled. Lady Susan, I believe, wishes to speak to you about it,
      if you are at leisure." "Certainly," I replied, deeply sighing at the
      recital of so lame a story. I made no comments, however, for words would
      have been vain.
    
    
      Reginald was glad to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious, indeed,
      to hear her account of it. "Did I not tell you," said she with a smile,
      "that your brother would not leave us after all?" "You did, indeed,"
      replied I very gravely; "but I flattered myself you would be mistaken." "I
      should not have hazarded such an opinion," returned she, "if it had not at
      that moment occurred to me that his resolution of going might be
      occasioned by a conversation in which we had been this morning engaged,
      and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction, from our not rightly
      understanding each other's meaning. This idea struck me at the moment, and
      I instantly determined that an accidental dispute, in which I might
      probably be as much to blame as himself, should not deprive you of your
      brother. If you remember, I left the room almost immediately. I was
      resolved to lose no time in clearing up those mistakes as far as I could.
      The case was this&mdash;Frederica had set herself violently against
      marrying Sir James." "And can your ladyship wonder that she should?" cried
      I with some warmth; "Frederica has an excellent understanding, and Sir
      James has none." "I am at least very far from regretting it, my dear
      sister," said she; "on the contrary, I am grateful for so favourable a
      sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is certainly below par (his boyish
      manners make him appear worse); and had Frederica possessed the
      penetration and the abilities which I could have wished in my daughter, or
      had I even known her to possess as much as she does, I should not have
      been anxious for the match." "It is odd that you should alone be ignorant
      of your daughter's sense!" "Frederica never does justice to herself; her
      manners are shy and childish, and besides she is afraid of me. During her
      poor father's life she was a spoilt child; the severity which it has since
      been necessary for me to show has alienated her affection; neither has she
      any of that brilliancy of intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which
      will force itself forward." "Say rather that she has been unfortunate in
      her education!" "Heaven knows, my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am
      aware of that; but I would wish to forget every circumstance that might
      throw blame on the memory of one whose name is sacred with me." Here she
      pretended to cry; I was out of patience with her. "But what," said I, "was
      your ladyship going to tell me about your disagreement with my brother?"
      "It originated in an action of my daughter's, which equally marks her want
      of judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been mentioning&mdash;she
      wrote to Mr. De Courcy." "I know she did; you had forbidden her speaking
      to Mr. Vernon or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she do,
      therefore, but apply to my brother?" "Good God!" she exclaimed, "what an
      opinion you must have of me! Can you possibly suppose that I was aware of
      her unhappiness! that it was my object to make my own child miserable, and
      that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the subject from a fear of
      your interrupting the diabolical scheme? Do you think me destitute of
      every honest, every natural feeling? Am I capable of consigning HER to
      everlasting misery whose welfare it is my first earthly duty to promote?
      The idea is horrible!" "What, then, was your intention when you insisted
      on her silence?" "Of what use, my dear sister, could be any application to
      you, however the affair might stand? Why should I subject you to
      entreaties which I refused to attend to myself? Neither for your sake nor
      for hers, nor for my own, could such a thing be desirable. When my own
      resolution was taken I could not wish for the interference, however
      friendly, of another person. I was mistaken, it is true, but I believed
      myself right." "But what was this mistake to which your ladyship so often
      alludes! from whence arose so astonishing a misconception of your
      daughter's feelings! Did you not know that she disliked Sir James?" "I
      knew that he was not absolutely the man she would have chosen, but I was
      persuaded that her objections to him did not arise from any perception of
      his deficiency. You must not question me, however, my dear sister, too
      minutely on this point," continued she, taking me affectionately by the
      hand; "I honestly own that there is something to conceal. Frederica makes
      me very unhappy! Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly."
      "What is it you mean to infer," said I, "by this appearance of mystery? If
      you think your daughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to Sir
      James could not less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her
      objecting had been a consciousness of his folly; and why should your
      ladyship, at any rate, quarrel with my brother for an interference which,
      you must know, it is not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a
      manner?"
    
    
      "His disposition, you know, is warm, and he came to expostulate with me;
      his compassion all alive for this ill-used girl, this heroine in distress!
      We misunderstood each other: he believed me more to blame than I really
      was; I considered his interference less excusable than I now find it. I
      have a real regard for him, and was beyond expression mortified to find
      it, as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were both warm, and of course both
      to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchhill is consistent with his
      general eagerness. When I understood his intention, however, and at the
      same time began to think that we had been perhaps equally mistaken in each
      other's meaning, I resolved to have an explanation before it was too late.
      For any member of your family I must always feel a degree of affection,
      and I own it would have sensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De
      Courcy had ended so gloomily. I have now only to say further, that as I am
      convinced of Frederica's having a reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall
      instantly inform him that he must give up all hope of her. I reproach
      myself for having, even though innocently, made her unhappy on that score.
      She shall have all the retribution in my power to make; if she value her
      own happiness as much as I do, if she judge wisely, and command herself as
      she ought, she may now be easy. Excuse me, my dearest sister, for thus
      trespassing on your time, but I owe it to my own character; and after this
      explanation I trust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion." I could
      have said, "Not much, indeed!" but I left her almost in silence. It was
      the greatest stretch of forbearance I could practise. I could not have
      stopped myself had I begun. Her assurance! her deceit! but I will not
      allow myself to dwell on them; they will strike you sufficiently. My heart
      sickens within me. As soon as I was tolerably composed I returned to the
      parlour. Sir James's carriage was at the door, and he, merry as usual,
      soon afterwards took his leave. How easily does her ladyship encourage or
      dismiss a lover! In spite of this release, Frederica still looks unhappy:
      still fearful, perhaps, of her mother's anger; and though dreading my
      brother's departure, jealous, it may be, of his staying. I see how closely
      she observes him and Lady Susan, poor girl! I have now no hope for her.
      There is not a chance of her affection being returned. He thinks very
      differently of her from what he used to do; he does her some justice, but
      his reconciliation with her mother precludes every dearer hope. Prepare,
      my dear mother, for the worst! The probability of their marrying is surely
      heightened! He is more securely hers than ever. When that wretched event
      takes place, Frederica must belong wholly to us. I am thankful that my
      last letter will precede this by so little, as every moment that you can
      be saved from feeling a joy which leads only to disappointment is of
      consequence.
    
    
      Yours ever, &amp;c.,
    
    
      CATHERINE VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XXV
    
    
      LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      I call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am my own self, gay and
      triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in high
      irritation, and with ample cause. Nay, I know not whether I ought to be
      quite tranquil now, for I have had more trouble in restoring peace than I
      ever intended to submit to&mdash;a spirit, too, resulting from a fancied
      sense of superior integrity, which is peculiarly insolent! I shall not
      easily forgive him, I assure you. He was actually on the point of leaving
      Churchhill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson brought me word
      of it. I found, therefore, that something must be done; for I did not
      choose to leave my character at the mercy of a man whose passions are so
      violent and so revengeful. It would have been trifling with my reputation
      to allow of his departing with such an impression in my disfavour; in this
      light, condescension was necessary. I sent Wilson to say that I desired to
      speak with him before he went; he came immediately. The angry emotions
      which had marked every feature when we last parted were partially subdued.
      He seemed astonished at the summons, and looked as if half wishing and
      half fearing to be softened by what I might say. If my countenance
      expressed what I aimed at, it was composed and dignified; and yet, with a
      degree of pensiveness which might convince him that I was not quite happy.
      "I beg your pardon, sir, for the liberty I have taken in sending for you,"
      said I; "but as I have just learnt your intention of leaving this place
      to-day, I feel it my duty to entreat that you will not on my account
      shorten your visit here even an hour. I am perfectly aware that after what
      has passed between us it would ill suit the feelings of either to remain
      longer in the same house: so very great, so total a change from the
      intimacy of friendship must render any future intercourse the severest
      punishment; and your resolution of quitting Churchhill is undoubtedly in
      unison with our situation, and with those lively feelings which I know you
      to possess. But, at the same time, it is not for me to suffer such a
      sacrifice as it must be to leave relations to whom you are so much
      attached, and are so dear. My remaining here cannot give that pleasure to
      Mr. and Mrs. Vernon which your society must; and my visit has already
      perhaps been too long. My removal, therefore, which must, at any rate,
      take place soon, may, with perfect convenience, be hastened; and I make it
      my particular request that I may not in any way be instrumental in
      separating a family so affectionately attached to each other. Where I go
      is of no consequence to anyone; of very little to myself; but you are of
      importance to all your connections." Here I concluded, and I hope you will
      be satisfied with my speech. Its effect on Reginald justifies some portion
      of vanity, for it was no less favourable than instantaneous. Oh, how
      delightful it was to watch the variations of his countenance while I
      spoke! to see the struggle between returning tenderness and the remains of
      displeasure. There is something agreeable in feelings so easily worked on;
      not that I envy him their possession, nor would, for the world, have such
      myself; but they are very convenient when one wishes to influence the
      passions of another. And yet this Reginald, whom a very few words from me
      softened at once into the utmost submission, and rendered more tractable,
      more attached, more devoted than ever, would have left me in the first
      angry swelling of his proud heart without deigning to seek an explanation.
      Humbled as he now is, I cannot forgive him such an instance of pride, and
      am doubtful whether I ought not to punish him by dismissing him at once
      after this reconciliation, or by marrying and teazing him for ever. But
      these measures are each too violent to be adopted without some
      deliberation; at present my thoughts are fluctuating between various
      schemes. I have many things to compass: I must punish Frederica, and
      pretty severely too, for her application to Reginald; I must punish him
      for receiving it so favourably, and for the rest of his conduct. I must
      torment my sister-in-law for the insolent triumph of her look and manner
      since Sir James has been dismissed; for, in reconciling Reginald to me, I
      was not able to save that ill-fated young man; and I must make myself
      amends for the humiliation to which I have stooped within these few days.
      To effect all this I have various plans. I have also an idea of being soon
      in town; and whatever may be my determination as to the rest, I shall
      probably put THAT project in execution; for London will be always the
      fairest field of action, however my views may be directed; and at any rate
      I shall there be rewarded by your society, and a little dissipation, for a
      ten weeks' penance at Churchhill. I believe I owe it to my character to
      complete the match between my daughter and Sir James after having so long
      intended it. Let me know your opinion on this point. Flexibility of mind,
      a disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which you know I
      am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any claim to the
      indulgence of her notions at the expense of her mother's inclinations. Her
      idle love for Reginald, too! It is surely my duty to discourage such
      romantic nonsense. All things considered, therefore, it seems incumbent on
      me to take her to town and marry her immediately to Sir James. When my own
      will is effected contrary to his, I shall have some credit in being on
      good terms with Reginald, which at present, in fact, I have not; for
      though he is still in my power, I have given up the very article by which
      our quarrel was produced, and at best the honour of victory is doubtful.
      Send me your opinion on all these matters, my dear Alicia, and let me know
      whether you can get lodgings to suit me within a short distance of you.
    
    
      Your most attached
    
    
      S. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XXVI
    
    
      MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN
    
    
      Edward Street.
    
    
      I am gratified by your reference, and this is my advice: that you come to
      town yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave Frederica behind.
      It would surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself well
      established by marrying Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him and the rest
      of his family by making her marry Sir James. You should think more of
      yourself and less of your daughter. She is not of a disposition to do you
      credit in the world, and seems precisely in her proper place at
      Churchhill, with the Vernons. But you are fitted for society, and it is
      shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore, to punish
      herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that romantic
      tender-heartedness which will always ensure her misery enough, and come to
      London as soon as you can. I have another reason for urging this:
      Mainwaring came to town last week, and has contrived, in spite of Mr.
      Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is absolutely miserable
      about you, and jealous to such a degree of De Courcy that it would be
      highly unadvisable for them to meet at present. And yet, if you do not
      allow him to see you here, I cannot answer for his not committing some
      great imprudence&mdash;such as going to Churchhill, for instance, which
      would be dreadful! Besides, if you take my advice, and resolve to marry De
      Courcy, it will be indispensably necessary to you to get Mainwaring out of
      the way; and you only can have influence enough to send him back to his
      wife. I have still another motive for your coming: Mr. Johnson leaves
      London next Tuesday; he is going for his health to Bath, where, if the
      waters are favourable to his constitution and my wishes, he will be laid
      up with the gout many weeks. During his absence we shall be able to chuse
      our own society, and to have true enjoyment. I would ask you to Edward
      Street, but that once he forced from me a kind of promise never to invite
      you to my house; nothing but my being in the utmost distress for money
      should have extorted it from me. I can get you, however, a nice
      drawing-room apartment in Upper Seymour Street, and we may be always
      together there or here; for I consider my promise to Mr. Johnson as
      comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the
      house. Poor Mainwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy.
      Silly woman to expect constancy from so charming a man! but she always was
      silly&mdash;intolerably so in marrying him at all, she the heiress of a
      large fortune and he without a shilling: one title, I know, she might have
      had, besides baronets. Her folly in forming the connection was so great
      that, though Mr. Johnson was her guardian, and I do not in general share
      HIS feelings, I never can forgive her.
    
    
      Adieu. Yours ever,
    
    
      ALICIA. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XXVII
    
    
      MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY
    
    
      Churchhill.
    
    
      This letter, my dear Mother, will be brought you by Reginald. His long
      visit is about to be concluded at last, but I fear the separation takes
      place too late to do us any good. She is going to London to see her
      particular friend, Mrs. Johnson. It was at first her intention that
      Frederica should accompany her, for the benefit of masters, but we
      overruled her there. Frederica was wretched in the idea of going, and I
      could not bear to have her at the mercy of her mother; not all the masters
      in London could compensate for the ruin of her comfort. I should have
      feared, too, for her health, and for everything but her principles&mdash;there
      I believe she is not to be injured by her mother, or her mother's friends;
      but with those friends she must have mixed (a very bad set, I doubt not),
      or have been left in total solitude, and I can hardly tell which would
      have been worse for her. If she is with her mother, moreover, she must,
      alas! in all probability be with Reginald, and that would be the greatest
      evil of all. Here we shall in time be in peace, and our regular
      employments, our books and conversations, with exercise, the children, and
      every domestic pleasure in my power to procure her, will, I trust,
      gradually overcome this youthful attachment. I should not have a doubt of
      it were she slighted for any other woman in the world than her own mother.
      How long Lady Susan will be in town, or whether she returns here again, I
      know not. I could not be cordial in my invitation, but if she chuses to
      come no want of cordiality on my part will keep her away. I could not help
      asking Reginald if he intended being in London this winter, as soon as I
      found her ladyship's steps would be bent thither; and though he professed
      himself quite undetermined, there was something in his look and voice as
      he spoke which contradicted his words. I have done with lamentation; I
      look upon the event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in
      despair. If he leaves you soon for London everything will be concluded.
    
    
      Your affectionate, &amp;c.,
    
    
      C. VERNON. 
       
    
    
      
    
    
      XXVIII
    
    
      MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN
    
    
      Edward Street.
    
    
      My dearest Friend,&mdash;I write in the greatest distress; the most
      unfortunate event has just taken place. Mr. Johnson has hit on the most
      effectual manner of plaguing us all. He had heard, I imagine, by some
      means or other, that you were soon to be in London, and immediately
      contrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay his
      journey to Bath, if not wholly prevent it. I am persuaded the gout is
      brought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I wanted to join
      the Hamiltons to the Lakes; and three years ago, when I had a fancy for
      Bath, nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom.
    
    
      I am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that De
      Courcy is certainly your own. Let me hear from you as soon as you arrive,
      and in particular tell me what you mean to do with Mainwaring. It is
      impossible to say when I shall be able to come to you; my confinement must
      be great. It is such an abominable trick to be ill here instead of at Bath
      that I can scarcely command myself at all. At Bath his old aunts would
      have nursed him, but here it all falls upon me; and he bears pain with
      such patience that I have not the common excuse for losing my temper.
    
    
      Yours ever,

      My dear Alicia,&mdash;There needed not this last fit of the gout to make
      me detest Mr. Johnson, but now the extent of my aversion is not to be
      estimated. To have you confined as nurse in his apartment! My dear Alicia,
      of what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age! just old
      enough to be formal, ungovernable, and to have the gout; too old to be
      agreeable, too young to die. I arrived last night about five, had scarcely
      swallowed my dinner when Mainwaring made his appearance. I will not
      dissemble what real pleasure his sight afforded me, nor how strongly I
      felt the contrast between his person and manners and those of Reginald, to
      the infinite disadvantage of the latter. For an hour or two I was even
      staggered in my resolution of marrying him, and though this was too idle
      and nonsensical an idea to remain long on my mind, I do not feel very
      eager for the conclusion of my marriage, nor look forward with much
      impatience to the time when Reginald, according to our agreement, is to be
      in town. I shall probably put off his arrival under some pretence or
      other. He must not come till Mainwaring is gone. I am still doubtful at
      times as to marrying; if the old man would die I might not hesitate, but a
      state of dependance on the caprice of Sir Reginald will not suit the
      freedom of my spirit; and if I resolve to wait for that event, I shall
      have excuse enough at present in having been scarcely ten months a widow.
      I have not given Mainwaring any hint of my intention, or allowed him to
      consider my acquaintance with Reginald as more than the commonest
      flirtation, and he is tolerably appeased. Adieu, till we meet; I am
      enchanted with my lodgings.
    
    
      Yours ever,

      XXX
    
    
      LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MR. DE COURCY
    
    
      Upper Seymour Street.
    
    
      I have received your letter, and though I do not attempt to conceal that I
      am gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet feel myself
      under the necessity of delaying that hour beyond the time originally
      fixed. Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of my power, nor accuse
      me of instability without first hearing my reasons. In the course of my
      journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for reflection on the present
      state of our affairs, and every review has served to convince me that they
      require a delicacy and cautiousness of conduct to which we have hitherto
      been too little attentive. We have been hurried on by our feelings to a
      degree of precipitation which ill accords with the claims of our friends
      or the opinion of the world. We have been unguarded in forming this hasty
      engagement, but we must not complete the imprudence by ratifying it while
      there is so much reason to fear the connection would be opposed by those
      friends on whom you depend. It is not for us to blame any expectations on
      your father's side of your marrying to advantage; where possessions are so
      extensive as those of your family, the wish of increasing them, if not
      strictly reasonable, is too common to excite surprize or resentment. He
      has a right to require; a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law, and I
      am sometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a
      connection so imprudent; but the influence of reason is often acknowledged
      too late by those who feel like me. I have now been but a few months a
      widow, and, however little indebted to my husband's memory for any
      happiness derived from him during a union of some years, I cannot forget
      that the indelicacy of so early a second marriage must subject me to the
      censure of the world, and incur, what would be still more insupportable,
      the displeasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps harden myself in time
      against the injustice of general reproach, but the loss of HIS valued
      esteem I am, as you well know, ill-fitted to endure; and when to this may
      be added the consciousness of having injured you with your family, how am
      I to support myself? With feelings so poignant as mine, the conviction of
      having divided the son from his parents would make me, even with you, the
      most miserable of beings. It will surely, therefore, be advisable to delay
      our union&mdash;to delay it till appearances are more promising&mdash;till
      affairs have taken a more favourable turn. To assist us in such a
      resolution I feel that absence will be necessary. We must not meet. Cruel
      as this sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing it, which can
      alone reconcile it to myself, will be evident to you when you have
      considered our situation in the light in which I have found myself
      imperiously obliged to place it. You may be&mdash;you must be&mdash;well
      assured that nothing but the strongest conviction of duty could induce me
      to wound my own feelings by urging a lengthened separation, and of
      insensibility to yours you will hardly suspect me. Again, therefore, I say
      that we ought not, we must not, yet meet. By a removal for some months
      from each other we shall tranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon,
      who, accustomed herself to the enjoyment of riches, considers fortune as
      necessary everywhere, and whose sensibilities are not of a nature to
      comprehend ours. Let me hear from you soon&mdash;very soon. Tell me that
      you submit to my arguments, and do not reproach me for using such. I
      cannot bear reproaches: my spirits are not so high as to need being
      repressed. I must endeavour to seek amusement, and fortunately many of my
      friends are in town; amongst them the Mainwarings; you know how sincerely
      I regard both husband and wife.
    
    
      I am, very faithfully yours,

      My dear Friend,&mdash;That tormenting creature, Reginald, is here. My
      letter, which was intended to keep him longer in the country, has hastened
      him to town. Much as I wish him away, however, I cannot help being pleased
      with such a proof of attachment. He is devoted to me, heart and soul. He
      will carry this note himself, which is to serve as an introduction to you,
      with whom he longs to be acquainted. Allow him to spend the evening with
      you, that I may be in no danger of his returning here. I have told him
      that I am not quite well, and must be alone; and should he call again
      there might be confusion, for it is impossible to be sure of servants.
      Keep him, therefore, I entreat you, in Edward Street. You will not find
      him a heavy companion, and I allow you to flirt with him as much as you
      like. At the same time, do not forget my real interest; say all that you
      can to convince him that I shall be quite wretched if he remains here; you
      know my reasons&mdash;propriety, and so forth. I would urge them more
      myself, but that I am impatient to be rid of him, as Mainwaring comes
      within half an hour. Adieu!

      Edward Street.
    
    
      My dear Creature,&mdash;I am in agonies, and know not what to do. Mr. De
      Courcy arrived just when he should not. Mrs. Mainwaring had that instant
      entered the house, and forced herself into her guardian's presence, though
      I did not know a syllable of it till afterwards, for I was out when both
      she and Reginald came, or I should have sent him away at all events; but
      she was shut up with Mr. Johnson, while he waited in the drawing-room for
      me. She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her husband, but perhaps you know
      this already from himself. She came to this house to entreat my husband's
      interference, and before I could be aware of it, everything that you could
      wish to be concealed was known to him, and unluckily she had wormed out of
      Mainwaring's servant that he had visited you every day since your being in
      town, and had just watched him to your door herself! What could I do!
      Facts are such horrid things! All is by this time known to De Courcy, who
      is now alone with Mr. Johnson. Do not accuse me; indeed, it was impossible
      to prevent it. Mr. Johnson has for some time suspected De Courcy of
      intending to marry you, and would speak with him alone as soon as he knew
      him to be in the house. That detestable Mrs. Mainwaring, who, for your
      comfort, has fretted herself thinner and uglier than ever, is still here,
      and they have been all closeted together. What can be done? At any rate, I
      hope he will plague his wife more than ever. With anxious wishes, Yours
      faithfully,

      This eclaircissement is rather provoking. How unlucky that you should have
      been from home! I thought myself sure of you at seven! I am undismayed
      however. Do not torment yourself with fears on my account; depend on it, I
      can make my story good with Reginald. Mainwaring is just gone; he brought
      me the news of his wife's arrival. Silly woman, what does she expect by
      such manoeuvres? Yet I wish she had stayed quietly at Langford. Reginald
      will be a little enraged at first, but by to-morrow's dinner, everything
      will be well again.
    
    
      Adieu!

      I write only to bid you farewell, the spell is removed; I see you as you
      are. Since we parted yesterday, I have received from indisputable
      authority such a history of you as must bring the most mortifying
      conviction of the imposition I have been under, and the absolute necessity
      of an immediate and eternal separation from you. You cannot doubt to what
      I allude. Langford! Langford! that word will be sufficient. I received my
      information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs. Mainwaring herself. You know
      how I have loved you; you can intimately judge of my present feelings, but
      I am not so weak as to find indulgence in describing them to a woman who
      will glory in having excited their anguish, but whose affection they have
      never been able to gain.

      I will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the note this
      moment received from you. I am bewildered in my endeavours to form some
      rational conjecture of what Mrs. Mainwaring can have told you to occasion
      so extraordinary a change in your sentiments. Have I not explained
      everything to you with respect to myself which could bear a doubtful
      meaning, and which the ill-nature of the world had interpreted to my
      discredit? What can you now have heard to stagger your esteem for me? Have
      I ever had a concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate me beyond
      expression, I cannot suppose that the old story of Mrs. Mainwaring's
      jealousy can be revived again, or at least be LISTENED to again. Come to
      me immediately, and explain what is at present absolutely
      incomprehensible. Believe me the single word of Langford is not of such
      potent intelligence as to supersede the necessity of more. If we ARE to
      part, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leave&mdash;but I
      have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be sunk,
      though but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I know
      not how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.

      Why would you write to me? Why do you require particulars? But, since it
      must be so, I am obliged to declare that all the accounts of your
      misconduct during the life, and since the death of Mr. Vernon, which had
      reached me, in common with the world in general, and gained my entire
      belief before I saw you, but which you, by the exertion of your perverted
      abilities, had made me resolved to disallow, have been unanswerably proved
      to me; nay more, I am assured that a connection, of which I had never
      before entertained a thought, has for some time existed, and still
      continues to exist, between you and the man whose family you robbed of its
      peace in return for the hospitality with which you were received into it;
      that you have corresponded with him ever since your leaving Langford; not
      with his wife, but with him, and that he now visits you every day. Can
      you, dare you deny it? and all this at the time when I was an encouraged,
      an accepted lover! From what have I not escaped! I have only to be
      grateful. Far from me be all complaint, every sigh of regret. My own folly
      had endangered me, my preservation I owe to the kindness, the integrity of
      another; but the unfortunate Mrs. Mainwaring, whose agonies while she
      related the past seemed to threaten her reason, how is SHE to be consoled!
      After such a discovery as this, you will scarcely affect further wonder at
      my meaning in bidding you adieu. My understanding is at length restored,
      and teaches no less to abhor the artifices which had subdued me than to
      despise myself for the weakness on which their strength was founded.

      I am satisfied, and will trouble you no more when these few lines are
      dismissed. The engagement which you were eager to form a fortnight ago is
      no longer compatible with your views, and I rejoice to find that the
      prudent advice of your parents has not been given in vain. Your
      restoration to peace will, I doubt not, speedily follow this act of filial
      obedience, and I flatter myself with the hope of surviving my share in
      this disappointment.

      I am grieved, though I cannot be astonished at your rupture with Mr. De
      Courcy; he has just informed Mr. Johnson of it by letter. He leaves
      London, he says, to-day. Be assured that I partake in all your feelings,
      and do not be angry if I say that our intercourse, even by letter, must
      soon be given up. It makes me miserable; but Mr. Johnson vows that if I
      persist in the connection, he will settle in the country for the rest of
      his life, and you know it is impossible to submit to such an extremity
      while any other alternative remains. You have heard of course that the
      Mainwarings are to part, and I am afraid Mrs. M. will come home to us
      again; but she is still so fond of her husband, and frets so much about
      him, that perhaps she may not live long. Miss Mainwaring is just come to
      town to be with her aunt, and they say that she declares she will have Sir
      James Martin before she leaves London again. If I were you, I would
      certainly get him myself. I had almost forgot to give you my opinion of
      Mr. De Courcy; I am really delighted with him; he is full as handsome, I
      think, as Mainwaring, and with such an open, good-humoured countenance,
      that one cannot help loving him at first sight. Mr. Johnson and he are the
      greatest friends in the world. Adieu, my dearest Susan, I wish matters did
      not go so perversely. That unlucky visit to Langford! but I dare say you
      did all for the best, and there is no defying destiny.

      My dear Alicia,&mdash;I yield to the necessity which parts us. Under
      circumstances you could not act otherwise. Our friendship cannot be
      impaired by it, and in happier times, when your situation is as
      independent as mine, it will unite us again in the same intimacy as ever.
      For this I shall impatiently wait, and meanwhile can safely assure you
      that I never was more at ease, or better satisfied with myself and
      everything about me than at the present hour. Your husband I abhor,
      Reginald I despise, and I am secure of never seeing either again. Have I
      not reason to rejoice? Mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever; and
      were we at liberty, I doubt if I could resist even matrimony offered by
      HIM. This event, if his wife live with you, it may be in your power to
      hasten. The violence of her feelings, which must wear her out, may be
      easily kept in irritation. I rely on your friendship for this. I am now
      satisfied that I never could have brought myself to marry Reginald, and am
      equally determined that Frederica never shall. To-morrow, I shall fetch
      her from Churchhill, and let Maria Mainwaring tremble for the consequence.
      Frederica shall be Sir James's wife before she quits my house, and she may
      whimper, and the Vernons may storm, I regard them not. I am tired of
      submitting my will to the caprices of others; of resigning my own judgment
      in deference to those to whom I owe no duty, and for whom I feel no
      respect. I have given up too much, have been too easily worked on, but
      Frederica shall now feel the difference. Adieu, dearest of friends; may
      the next gouty attack be more favourable! and may you always regard me as
      unalterably yours,

      My dear Catherine,&mdash;I have charming news for you, and if I had not
      sent off my letter this morning you might have been spared the vexation of
      knowing of Reginald's being gone to London, for he is returned. Reginald
      is returned, not to ask our consent to his marrying Lady Susan, but to
      tell us they are parted for ever. He has been only an hour in the house,
      and I have not been able to learn particulars, for he is so very low that
      I have not the heart to ask questions, but I hope we shall soon know all.
      This is the most joyful hour he has ever given us since the day of his
      birth. Nothing is wanting but to have you here, and it is our particular
      wish and entreaty that you would come to us as soon as you can. You have
      owed us a visit many long weeks; I hope nothing will make it inconvenient
      to Mr. Vernon; and pray bring all my grand-children; and your dear niece
      is included, of course; I long to see her. It has been a sad, heavy winter
      hitherto, without Reginald, and seeing nobody from Churchhill. I never
      found the season so dreary before; but this happy meeting will make us
      young again. Frederica runs much in my thoughts, and when Reginald has
      recovered his usual good spirits (as I trust he soon will) we will try to
      rob him of his heart once more, and I am full of hopes of seeing their
      hands joined at no great distance.

      My dear Mother,&mdash;Your letter has surprized me beyond measure! Can it
      be true that they are really separated&mdash;and for ever? I should be
      overjoyed if I dared depend on it, but after all that I have seen how can
      one be secure. And Reginald really with you! My surprize is the greater
      because on Wednesday, the very day of his coming to Parklands, we had a
      most unexpected and unwelcome visit from Lady Susan, looking all
      cheerfulness and good-humour, and seeming more as if she were to marry him
      when she got to London than as if parted from him for ever. She stayed
      nearly two hours, was as affectionate and agreeable as ever, and not a
      syllable, not a hint was dropped, of any disagreement or coolness between
      them. I asked her whether she had seen my brother since his arrival in
      town; not, as you may suppose, with any doubt of the fact, but merely to
      see how she looked. She immediately answered, without any embarrassment,
      that he had been kind enough to call on her on Monday; but she believed he
      had already returned home, which I was very far from crediting. Your kind
      invitation is accepted by us with pleasure, and on Thursday next we and
      our little ones will be with you. Pray heaven, Reginald may not be in town
      again by that time! I wish we could bring dear Frederica too, but I am
      sorry to say that her mother's errand hither was to fetch her away; and,
      miserable as it made the poor girl, it was impossible to detain her. I was
      thoroughly unwilling to let her go, and so was her uncle; and all that
      could be urged we did urge; but Lady Susan declared that as she was now
      about to fix herself in London for several months, she could not be easy
      if her daughter were not with her for masters, &amp;c. Her manner, to be
      sure, was very kind and proper, and Mr. Vernon believes that Frederica
      will now be treated with affection. I wish I could think so too. The poor
      girl's heart was almost broke at taking leave of us. I charged her to
      write to me very often, and to remember that if she were in any distress
      we should be always her friends. I took care to see her alone, that I
      might say all this, and I hope made her a little more comfortable; but I
      shall not be easy till I can go to town and judge of her situation myself.
      I wish there were a better prospect than now appears of the match which
      the conclusion of your letter declares your expectations of. At present,
      it is not very likely,
    
    
      Yours ever, &amp;c.,

      CONCLUSION
    
    
      This correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties, and a
      separation between the others, could not, to the great detriment of the
      Post Office revenue, be continued any longer. Very little assistance to
      the State could be derived from the epistolary intercourse of Mrs. Vernon
      and her niece; for the former soon perceived, by the style of Frederica's
      letters, that they were written under her mother's inspection! and
      therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she could make it
      personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often. Having learnt
      enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother, of what had
      passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower than ever in
      her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get Frederica removed
      from such a mother, and placed under her own care; and, though with little
      hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing unattempted that might
      offer a chance of obtaining her sister-in-law's consent to it. Her anxiety
      on the subject made her press for an early visit to London; and Mr.
      Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared, lived only to do whatever
      he was desired, soon found some accommodating business to call him
      thither. With a heart full of the matter, Mrs. Vernon waited on Lady Susan
      shortly after her arrival in town, and was met with such an easy and
      cheerful affection, as made her almost turn from her with horror. No
      remembrance of Reginald, no consciousness of guilt, gave one look of
      embarrassment; she was in excellent spirits, and seemed eager to show at
      once by ever possible attention to her brother and sister her sense of
      their kindness, and her pleasure in their society. Frederica was no more
      altered than Lady Susan; the same restrained manners, the same timid look
      in the presence of her mother as heretofore, assured her aunt of her
      situation being uncomfortable, and confirmed her in the plan of altering
      it. No unkindness, however, on the part of Lady Susan appeared.
      Persecution on the subject of Sir James was entirely at an end; his name
      merely mentioned to say that he was not in London; and indeed, in all her
      conversation, she was solicitous only for the welfare and improvement of
      her daughter, acknowledging, in terms of grateful delight, that Frederica
      was now growing every day more and more what a parent could desire. Mrs.
      Vernon, surprized and incredulous, knew not what to suspect, and, without
      any change in her own views, only feared greater difficulty in
      accomplishing them. The first hope of anything better was derived from
      Lady Susan's asking her whether she thought Frederica looked quite as well
      as she had done at Churchhill, as she must confess herself to have
      sometimes an anxious doubt of London's perfectly agreeing with her. Mrs.
      Vernon, encouraging the doubt, directly proposed her niece's returning
      with them into the country. Lady Susan was unable to express her sense of
      such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety of reasons, how to part with
      her daughter; and as, though her own plans were not yet wholly fixed, she
      trusted it would ere long be in her power to take Frederica into the
      country herself, concluded by declining entirely to profit by such
      unexampled attention. Mrs. Vernon persevered, however, in the offer of it,
      and though Lady Susan continued to resist, her resistance in the course of
      a few days seemed somewhat less formidable. The lucky alarm of an
      influenza decided what might not have been decided quite so soon. Lady
      Susan's maternal fears were then too much awakened for her to think of
      anything but Frederica's removal from the risk of infection; above all
      disorders in the world she most dreaded the influenza for her daughter's
      constitution!
    
    
      Frederica returned to Churchhill with her uncle and aunt; and three weeks
      afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to Sir James Martin.
      Mrs. Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected before, that
      she might have spared herself all the trouble of urging a removal which
      Lady Susan had doubtless resolved on from the first. Frederica's visit was
      nominally for six weeks, but her mother, though inviting her to return in
      one or two affectionate letters, was very ready to oblige the whole party
      by consenting to a prolongation of her stay, and in the course of two
      months ceased to write of her absence, and in the course of two or more to
      write to her at all. Frederica was therefore fixed in the family of her
      uncle and aunt till such time as Reginald De Courcy could be talked,
      flattered, and finessed into an affection for her which, allowing leisure
      for the conquest of his attachment to her mother, for his abjuring all
      future attachments, and detesting the sex, might be reasonably looked for
      in the course of a twelvemonth. Three months might have done it in
      general, but Reginald's feelings were no less lasting than lively. Whether
      Lady Susan was or was not happy in her second choice, I do not see how it
      can ever be ascertained; for who would take her assurance of it on either
      side of the question? The world must judge from probabilities; she had
      nothing against her but her husband, and her conscience. Sir James may
      seem to have drawn a harder lot than mere folly merited; I leave him,
      therefore, to all the pity that anybody can give him. For myself, I
      confess that I can pity only Miss Mainwaring; who, coming to town, and
      putting herself to an expense in clothes which impoverished her for two
      years, on purpose to secure him, was defrauded of her due by a woman ten
      years older than herself.
